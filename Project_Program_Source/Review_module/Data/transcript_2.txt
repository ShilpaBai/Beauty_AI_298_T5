here's a little tip that works I noticed that she had silver earrings and a gold necklace and I was like clearly she can wear both metals because she's neutral you're probably like what [Music] hey everyone do you struggle finding that perfect Foundation match well in this video I'm going to show you some tips and tricks so that you can become the foundation match Master as you can see I've Got Something Brewing over here and I'm going to show you exactly how to do this so we have Farrah she is fresh faced and ready to go and we're gonna start the process of finding that perfect Foundation now the first thing you need to do is figure out where in the range of a foundation you fall in the tone meaning from light to dark and this is fairly easy to do you can look at a range of Foundations and go I'm kind of in this zone I'm a lighter I'm a light Medium as an example you got something really light and you've got something really dark where does she fall in the whole range well obviously it's not this dark obviously she's not this light maybe she's somewhere in this Zone that's what we're talking about when we say tone this is the easiest aspect of finding a section that's probably where your perfect color lives in so now that you've figured out the range of the tone where you might find your perfect Foundation you have to figure out that perfect shade now have you ever looked at a range of Foundations and you're like okay I'm somewhere in here and you pick the one you think is right and you put it on you're like this is not right I always struggle to find the right color everything that I pick is always way too yellow for me ding ding ding ding ding we've hit the magic word there she actually said it she said it turns out they're too yellow and that's because that magic factor of finding the perfect Foundation is also matching your undertone meaning are you warm are you yellow undertones are you cool more pink red undertones or you're actually neutral which is like a combo platter of both warm and cool really that determines whether or not that Foundation is going to just look perfect on on your skin and just melt right in and just look like your skin only better all that stuff that we want but how do you figure that out one of the best and easiest and most Surefire ways is to do a little stripes on the face sounds funny but you'll get the picture when I do it right now so I've got the makeup by Mario surreal skin Foundation I've chosen a range in her tone right from the light to the dark but I've got three different undertones here and now we're gonna find out which one works best so I like to take a cotton Bud a little bit of the foundation and then the best place to do this is on the jawline the reason is because we want to make sure the foundation looks good on the face but also Blends down into the neck which can sometimes be a little bit lighter because maybe it hasn't seen the sunlight so it's a truer form of your undertone so we're applying the first stripe this is a cool undertone and I can already tell that there's just a little bit too much coolness SMS a little too pink a little too red for her skin now obviously this is heavily put on her because we really want to see that color remember that when a foundation is very wet it's going to look lighter than what it is because it's going to reflect more light I am going to let it dry down to make that final decision but already I can kind of tell it's not the right one the next one we're gonna do another stripe right next to it a neutral undertone and now this one even at this heavy application is really looking like her skin tone so when we're already being able to identify that this is probably her undertone is probably a neutral but again we want to try a warm just to be safe and here we go applying that last stripe that's a warm undertone now here it's a little harder to tell because the warm kind of doesn't look that bad right and that's because everyone's undertone in general is a spectrum you can fall anywhere in the rainbow from really warm to neutral to really cool you can be anywhere in here so you can be neutral slightly cool neutral slightly warm it will come down to a personal choice but when we're looking for a true match we're really looking for something that's going to be the closest to your undertone I can basically tell looking at this is probably the best one this color is technically considered a number that's lower than this one so this is a nine and this is an 11. even though you're in the right color tone it really does come down to that undertone being the right match as you can see the color striping is such a great and easy way to find that perfect Foundation match to see clearly which undertone works best for you but if you are shopping online or something and you can't get to Swatch here's a little tip that works and I noticed when I looked at pharah today that she had silver earrings and a gold necklace and I was like oh my God this is so perfect clearly she can wear both metals because she's neutral you're probably like what let me show you if you look really good with gold jewelry the likelihood is you have warm undertones if you look really good with silver jewelry the likelihood is you have cool undertones if you look really good with both gold and silver you're likely neutral so this is a really easy way to kind of give you some direction into where your skin undertone lies so did you know that is that no I had no idea people always would make comments like oh you're mixing silver and gold but now that makes sense you're one of the few that can mix them both easily but of course it's a preference so anyone can wear anything but it's a great way to tell and it was something I noticed right away on Fab so another thing I wanted to do with the stripes just to give you an idea once you've laid your stripes down because we've laid down such a heavy coat of them it is always good to just blend them in a little bit this is going to even give you more of an understanding of where these colors lie and how they're going to look on your skin as you can see it's already starting to really show how much that neutral is melting right into her skin this is such a nice mix here really that neutral just looks so good it just Blends right down into the skin on her neck it looks so natural obviously that's the winner and let's apply it and see what it looks like so we chose the color the shade is 11 n so for neutral that's one of the great things about makeup by Mario's labeling all the colors have an n a w or a c neutral warm or cool so that's very helpful like I always do I like to move it around the face through all the main areas and then blend always start your foundations light and then build them where needed it's got a nice natural radiant finish so it looks like healthy skin in the color is perfect on pharah now remember when it comes to finding the perfect Foundation you might have to alter your colors as the seasons change the same way you change your seasonal fashion wardrobes because you might be exposed to more sun more Beach time you might get a little tan and a tan is not an undertone it's a surface tone it's a color that changes due to environmental reasons so it's okay to have a wardrobe of Foundations the same way you have a wardrobe for your fashion during the summer when you're outside more you might need one color that's maybe a little bit warmer maybe a little bit deeper or in the winter when you're more inside maybe it's a more truer tone to your natural skin and a good thing to think about is how does it look here I have no makeup on her neck and when it comes down it's a really nice thing don't forget this is freshly applied so you can see there's a lot of shine on this so it's going to naturally look a little lighter until it dries down and then it's going to get a little bit darker or when you add powder as well okay so now that we've let the foundation dry down onto her skin and become its natural finish you can see it's a perfect match this is so good that neutral worked excellent on her the time has come are you ready for the reveal pharah yes take a look tell me what you think because it's really up to you this is like literally the perfect match it is so good and now you know in the future you're going to be going with neutral undertones though I think she's loving the makeup by Mario and so am I and for all of you out there I hope this was helpful don't forget you can shop the shelf right here and we'll see you all soon bye everyone foreign [Music]
