1 Minute Face Masks,"For what it is a one minute face mask it is sufficient I keep them in the refrigerator and when I want to feel refreshed I put one on for about 1015 minutes The cool mask plus the natural ingredients are very soothing for a moment of calm Are the effects long lasting No but what do you expect from a one minute face mask when others require to wear for 1520 minutes Whats great is that I have a petite face and these masks fit perfectly I am happy about that because most face masks are usually too large for me The price point on these masks is also very good I would love to see more varieties for this product The only downside for me is as I go through the masks it gets more challenging to get them out of the package The opening should be improved , total miss my skin didnt like it had a reaction my face was on fire but maybe its just me , I bought on sale but regret it It doesnt fit my face howevermy face is not that bigBut it is very small , I like to keep these in my fridge for mornings where Im a little extra puffy or dry I use my jade roller on top , I actually dont want to say how much I enjoy these so I can stock up on more of them Ive never been great with skincare routines but have been trying to do better especially during the dry autumnwinters here I really enjoy these  I like to use them after a shower a few times a week The moisture isnt crazy  they are only intended for a minute or so  but they stave off the worst of the dryness this time of year After use I squeeze out any extra product and use that on my neckarms The fitting isnt terrible for me  the mouth cutouts tend to be a little lower than what I need but its no big deal to work around that actually it can be downright funny Using 23week Im so happy to use these  I dont have to commit a bunch of time which is why I never got into skincare routines anyway and even when they are full price the bulk of 14 makes them economicallyfriendly At that 23week I would have to spend 300700 a year on masks if I relied only on more moisturizing but more expensive masks and these are a fraction of that cost These are good if you dont have the time or cash for the more heavyhitting products are like me where the motto is what skincare routine and would be handy for travel If youre looking for heavy moisturizing these would probably not cut it  I see them more as a maintenancelevel product and they are lovely for that , I rarely hate something enough to give it one starbut theres always a first I love sheet masks and use a variety of brands This is probably one of the worst sheet mask Ive ever used The size of the sheet mask is just strange I have an averaged size face but this sheet mask only covers 34 of my cheek The eye holes are surprisingly small I truly dont think their RD department actually used them on a human face before selling it Sadly the mask dries out very quickly too such a disappointment , After reading the reviews I decided to try this product for myself and also experienced a stinging sensation on my face after wearing the mask Though they were a good price its not worth it , I actually enjoy using these face mask as a selfcare treat for my face They definitely work and make my skin feel so soft and smooth  , It was super easy to apply it on my face and it makes my face cool I like it , Honestly Im a fan of these unsure why Everyone is so fussy  I use them after a dog walk or the gym if Im delayed getting to the shower  The eye holes are off  you will have to manage thatthe fabric  But its for 1 minute  Mine were moist I left the plastic wrapping inside the package in place and also intend to throw these in the fridge , I put them in the refrigerator and use one every morning Its not an intense mask but it is great for a daily refresh especially when kept cold Great way to brighten and seepuff quickly , What are these I bought them on sale they are all dried out , You would have better results cutting mouth and eye holes out of a wet napkin At least it would fit better than these Love the concept but this was a big fail for Sephora Even at the sale price this was a big disappointment , Svp faites une notre fois ca produit est magnifique , I like this item So travel friendly I went on a week long vacation to the beach and just popped one mask on my face before getting ready while I am doing things like ironing my clothes Its really hydrating and my skin felt calmed and soothed I am always going to carry a pack with me on my vacays I hope Sephora continues to sell them , Im obsessed with these They are perfect because they are quick and are super plumping I found these very hydrating and love using them 1010 , no las uso y tengo miedo de los comentarios no se si las voy a usar , I honestly love this mask for the price They are extremely quick and easy to use and they feel great on my skin , Refreshing Mask Great price I have bought multiple and use them when I want a quick soothing pick me up for my face definitely recommend , It was fine Didnt benefit my skin but felt nice A lot of product was left on the face and it took forever to soak in I will not repurchase , So quick and easy to use Skin feels great afterwards , I like the idea of this because if gives me baby wipes vibez Saves a lot of packaging also so I enjoyed them , I hate to say it but these masks did not work for me one bit It also did not hit my face appropriately and it kept coming off as I had it on I understand it doesnt cost very much but Sephora needs to step their game up a bit wasnt too happy with this purchase wound up throwing them away because it was a no go from the beginning the only one I do like is the caffeine one but I didnt realize that they had paper on both sides so I put them on without taking the paper off it was really hard to see I have glaucoma so I struggle with side , These are great little 1 minute mask they do just what they say I like them so much I went back in and bought another pack of them , Makes my face feel so good afterwards and my skin feels smooth , I absolutely love these masks I eventually got 2 more and I usually try and use them before I go to bed at night My boyfriend will usually use them with me and he loves them too , These masks are inexpensive but they are pretty dry and are not saturated with much product I would not buy again , I really like this mask It is quick refreshing and smells great It is such a great value It makes my skin feel and look so good , Its ok but nothing special It even gives my skin a sticky finish I will not buy it again Im not impressed , these are a very basic and comfortable hydrating mask with no harsh ingredients  so buy some while theyre cheap for your next girls night or sleepover theyll be a hit and you get FOURTEEN Im not going to try and say theyre the greatest sheet masks in the world but for the price youll never beat them , i was not sure at first because i saw a lot of bad review but i love those so much my skin is so glowy after i use 1 i put them more than 1 minutes and its ok for me totally recommand , I love to use these with the Sephora makeup remover wipes I just leave this on for a minute or so and then wipe the residual makeup off of my face this leaves me feeling hydrated and extra clean These are a very affordable option for both hydration and cleaning , Got it as a gift for mom so we could both enjoy spa days  She is a typical Ukrainian mother who does not care about beauty or skincare but rather focused on taking care of a household Though I typically enjoy luxurious and more expensive masks Im happy this is the first masks I introduced her into as a beginner of her skincare journey Reminds me of Tonymoly masks a little honestly Not to mention this is a great value for 14 masks 042 cents each mask really I also like the idea of packaging and how convenient it is Gotta stretch them out to fit it for your face shape though Really good , I really love this mace mask the one minute is everything and sometimes I leave on for 5 Leaves my face moisturized , This is such a steal Great valueand they work wonderfully My daughters and I love them , These are fabulous Theyre inexpensive and quick to use when you just want a little pick me up for your skin but dont have a lot of time to invest in a longer treatment I will definitely be buying these regularly even just for those times your want to do a little something nice for your skin , no it was very dry and ended up not using the last half , Too much love for this quick one minute mask They are my go to masks cuz Ive a very dehydrated and dry skin Also my skin is super sensitive but it is good so far , These work great on really dry days for an extra moisturizing boost I use one on clean skin  and then apply am products including additional moisturizer Just a nice inexpensive extra , Thought for secret Santa gift She seems to love have loved them , I got the lotus it smells so good It fit perfectly and it made my face feel great Definitely recommend , Oddly shaped did absolutely nothing for my skin and didnt even stay on for a minute because it kept falling off Didnt seem to have much product on it , I love these and they are cheaper than buying lots of individual mask so that is nice They are also very hydrating , I like these little masks You can 100 stretch them to fit your face thats what I did The reason Im giving 3 stars is because it made my face feel slimy and greasy And I already have super oily skin Theyre definitely hydrating although I will not repurchase , I love having masks on hand as I use them a couple times a week  This was a great bargain in that I received 14 sheets in the package  For single masks I find I throw away an awful log of product  I feel these are more efficient  However they are a bit more cumbersome to pull apart to apply to your face , I dont understand the bad reviews this masks are the best Guys if you feel them not adjusting well to your face you can stretch them a bit Im obsessed with my skin after using one of this The smell is delicate and not overpowering at all I hardly recommend them , I bought this on sale for 8 which is good value for it in my opinion Its nice but nothing groundbreaking I would not pay 17 for it personally although it is a relaxing and quick way to treat your face , I used these the week before my wedding and honestly a fantastic way to get a quick face mask in while using the ice rollers to further massage the serum into my skin definitely recommend , There are better but it kinda does the job not 100  but yet just fine , Love the conscience of these brilliant and affordable , Its okthe mask feels a bit dry when I just open it i say its about drugstore quality or less you are paying for what you get , Good for the price They hydrate my face and are good when you want to do a quick mask They are small but you can stretch them out to fit you face I do recommend for someone who wants a good cheap face mask , I got these when they were on sale I like the convenience of a lot of mask all in a small package on the go but then the masks are all dried up I initially thought okay maybe the first two from the opening might be dry the middle ones should be more moist Nope not at all The whole thing is so dry not even worth the money It doesnt do anything to your face might as well spend money on something more expensive and actually do the job , They were on sale so i took a chance Theyre okay You get what you pay for , Masque qui ne prend pas la forme de visage Ne se colle pas partout  la peau , You get what you pay for These masks are not very effective unless you just want a quick face refresher The masks arent very moisturized so they dry out very quickly after application Size of the masks are a little smaller and they didnt stick well to my face since they dry out fast Other than that its a nice 1 minute face mask like it states but if you want real results I recommend the real serum face masks , Got this to try and I must say Im glad I took the chanceSuper fast easily absorbed into my skinMakes my skin feel soft and look brightWould definitely recommendThanks Sephora , So why havent multi packs for sheet masks been a thing earlier It saves on packaging and is a much more environmental and economical choice I love throwing one of these bad girls on while Im brushing my teeth I layer it over my serum of choice and my shin feels refreshed after just one minute So convenientjust buy them , This really seems like its a glorified version of a makeup remover wipe Nothing special about it or worth paying extra for , Good for slumber parties where you dont mind wasting masks But they are very cheap and unreasonably sized Dont waste your money , Nothing at all like the OG sheet masks First off the eye holes are very smallat least for my eyes The material isnt as soft as the individual masks More like a makeup wipe consistency Also very drying Very disappointed Just buy the individual sheet masks instead , Feels fresh  moisturized my skinFast and easy time saver  , These were a repurchase for me they are a quick easy way to boost hydration  the fit isnt great but for one minute and a decent absorption of some good essence and at the regular price point let alone the sale price  I think theyre worth it , Better to just buy the Korean sheet masks outside of Sephora Even on sale these arent worth it The mask is way too smallnarrow and you can smell the alcohol content Did not make skin feel any different , Poor quality of cloth The whole thing is barely effective , Very cool products makes skin feels real soft and very fresh , This product has alcohol in it and it is pretty high up on the ingredient list Alcohol is drying so I dont understand why it would be in a hydrating mask , I actually love this product I try to do 23 face masks a week or so but that can get expensive These are great masks to throw into the mix to bring that cost down a bit They definitely arent as impactful as some of the higherend masks that I use but you get what you pay for That being said these masks still leave my skin brighter and more moisturizedOnly complaint here is the masks are not very big , Not as good as the other Sephora collections face masks The masks are too small and have a cloth like texture , Texture is more like a cleansing cloth than a mask  Contains a small amount of product , Thought the concept was cool and looks ascetically pleasing but the production itself is a no go Made my skin burn immediately upon application so I of course removed it and cleansed my face 010 in my book , I love all of the masks i  get from sephoras brand I wanted to try these I purchased the lotus  I do like they are a bit smaller then most of their sheet masks i have a small face and a lot of them a big and i have to use the face mask holder  These stay on well and i did leave it on a bit longer maybe 5 minutes and after my face was very hydrated and  glowy , Why spend 4 dollars for 1 mask when you can get 14 for 12 bucks I have a generally large face and this fit me just fine I also love the convenience of not having to open separate face mask sheets and pulling one out when I need to I love these so much Also theres enough moisture in the container its in so they dont dry out , This is a fantastic quick product to treat your skin I use it as part of my daily skincare routine as I prep my skin for makeup before and sometimes after work I hope they never discontinue this because it is amazing and even though it doesnt cover the whole face nothing rubbing the serum into those areas wont fix , The masks are sized too small They are sized for a small childs face Theres not much to them either Doesnt feel as good as sheet masks normally do , This is the perfect product if you want a quick bit of selfcare without spending too much money They made my skin feel refreshed and hydratedI used to buy only face masks for special occasions or when I really needed a pickmeup Now I will definitely keep these stocked , Good value product though sheet misses some facial points as you stretch the mask  , Great for a really quick morning mask Mask is very narrow so if you adjust it so it fits around your nose like it should then the eye holes are very close together If stretched out to fit the eyes better it doesnt properly cover the nose This is not a sit and relax while you watch tv mask The mouth hole is extremely small so you cant have a morning coffee while you wear this or an evening glass of wine But if kept in the fridge prior to use reduces puffiness Gives a nice blast of moisture to the face For a really quick mask these are worth it , These are perfect to pop on after the shower while youre putting on your body lotion  Leaves your skin feeling refreshed smooth and hydrated for the day , Great product for the price I leave them on for a few minutes and my face feels refreshed and moisturized and noticeable smoother afterwards These are more cost effective than the individual sheet masks , Its a good and quick pick me up for my skin Perfect for the busy night when I literally have just a minute , Great idea in theory but these masks just miss the mark for me They are so strangely shaped it looks like they are meant for C3PO not a human being When I stretch it to fit my eyes and mouth the mask no longer adheres to the area adjacent to my nose see photo shes not cute They also sting a little bit I dont generally have sensitive skin so Im not sure why this would happen Good for a quick pickmeup before a makeup application but Id work on the mask shape and formula  Most of the time I end up just taking the damp mask and swiping it on my face like a cotton pad of toner , Very innovative and creative idea for a quick facial The sheet mask does not fit comfortably on my face since the eye and mouth holes are too small but I still use it for the experience On the other hand my face was left refreshed and clean , I love these masks perfect for summer The masks are moist and hydrating with a cooling effectI like to use them on a day Ive been laying out or getting a lot of sun in my face I live at the beach in CA so im constantly getting sun exposure that feels like its drying me out I have a big head but they fit my face just fine maybe theyve made them bigger since the other reviews lol , sometimes you just really need to start your day with a sheet mask and this lets me quickly soak up some radiance while working on the rest of my routine Its a little small for my face but nothing that a little gentle stretching cant fix Love the avocado version as well , Broke my face out too strong of a fragrance for the face to put on , Big thanks to the reviewer who commented that these masks stretch The small size was the only downside to these but now I know that is totally solvable by gently pulling it slightly as you put it on And these stay on They dont slip so I can multitask while masking I have both the avocado and lotus masks Ill buy both again but I LOVE the avocado I have super sensitive combination skin prone to redness and outbreaks and these are gentle and soothing enough for everyday The avocado is more heavily moisturizing than the lotus and I come back to the avocado more often when Im using harsher cleansers to clear a breakout I tend to leave them on for at least five minutes because theres enough product on there to keep soaking in but they do a great job in only a minute if thats truly all the time you have , Got these to use on days in between my Dr Jart and Farmacy sheet mask days I just love sheet masks and miss the days in between using my amazing sheet masks I was disappointed with these but they were cheap so I thought I would try I cant even compare them to the good sheet masks I use Wont buy these again Woke up after using this for the first time and had a breakout which is extremely rare for me Threw them out right then and wont use again , Es bueno pero no es impresionante PRECIO JUSTO para lo que se recibe TYPE Avocado  nourishing and comforting , Personally I like these wipes They are cheap convenient and easy to use At most the only con with these wipes are that they are pretty small The eyes dont fit arent on the right place Mouth section is also quite small but I still say its worth the purchase , affordable to use more frequently than the typical sheet masks that cost 6 each To all the people saying they are small they are but they stretch really easily and with the silicone mask holder over it it worked out really well I like these for a quick little pampering treat every day or at least on days when I dont do a more expensive mask , Definitely too small to fit my face Did I accidentally buy a dried up childrens product , These work great but they are quite small so keep that in mind when purchasing this product It also irritates the skin a little bit so I would not recommend it to people who have sensitive skin Other than that the masks are doing the job and the scent is quite pleasant , the masks are small and dont cover your entire face I also found them to be a little rough on your skin they werent soft as other face masks Ive used the price is pretty good so it works if youre on a budget but theres better options out there if youre willing to spend a little more , This is the first face mask that actually fits my face Its not sliding off and i dont have half of it folded under my neck I got them as a gift and Im glad I did It feels nice and refreshing if youre looking for something quick , Ive only used this product one time specifically the lotus one but I will continue to use it because I think its such a fun product and I havent seen anything like this Its like baby wipes but face masks It doesnt have an overpowering scent and I didnt notice dramatic results but it is an awesome pick me up I like to help press the product into my skin by gently rolling my face with my jade roller while the sheet is still on my face I feel like it helps me get more out of the product I would recommend flipping the package over every time you use it so the product is evenly distributed among all wipes and doesnt just collect at the bottom making the last wipe super saturated with product I do this with all my wipes , These were terrible I noticed no benefit and it actually irritated my skin , the masks are super small  they are more suited to fit a little kids face , i take 1 star off for how small the masks are  luckily they are easy to stretch out to fit your face  these feel GREAT and you can actually FEEL them working  i am a daily sheet mask user using masks that range from 120 so i can confidently say you should buy these , I tried them last night for the first time yes they are a bit smaller than your usual sheet mask but not tiny like the other reviews claim I have a small face and it fit just fine no drip around the eye area nor burning I left it on for about 5 minutes and used a jade roller to massage it in then followed up with my usual Kate somerville anti bac cream because I have acne prone skin woke up and my acne scars were almost gone my redness had gone down SO much and my pores and skin looked plumped and extremely smoothed texture also no additional tiny bump or acne so it did nothing but benefit me Also the plump effect lasted ALL day I kept finding myself looking at the mirror to see if the plumpness had effect had gone away but nope so I know it wasnt just a morning effect I really did love it , Amazing value Yes they are smaller than individual sheet masks but they fit perfectly They have enough serum to last for 5 minutes or more I have 2 daughters and this is exactly what we need it so we can mask multiple times a week without breaking the bank , Neat Idea Great Package Awful Product Sticky  Pore clogging I love a lot that Sephora offers  actually need what it claims to offer so this didnt have to blow me away to worth while But it harms instead of helps my skin , These masks are too small Theyre narrow the eye holes are too close and small so the liquid will get in your eyes the mouth hole is too small Youd think Sephora would know how big adult faces are , This product is very useful for me because it keeps my skin hydrated after I finish mi acne cleaning routine which makes skin a little bit dry Very good results and excellent price , Excellent value I love to do these once a week right before bed So calming and nourishing , The Green one broke me out I mean the bumps were huge and I never breakout  , Waste of money I didnt  like it at all  but I still prefer to buy Sephora masks the one its stayed for 15 minute , Giving 5 stars for being exactly what theyre designed to be a quick cheap skin pickmeup These are not going to change your skin or feel like the luxe brands but Ive really enjoyed adding them to my routine I def recommend for using for longer than a minute I usually leave mine on for five or so Then I layer on some good serums over and then top with a good oil or creamy on my dry spots At less than a dollar per mask its not like you should be expecting a miracle mask but it hydrates and makes my skin happy Like the smell too , The price was good but why is there alcohol in a hydrating face mask The alcohol content was quite strong it actually stung my eyes Wont recommend , These are great and I usually use them for longer than a minute and use a vibrating hand held tool to push the serum deeper into my skin The value is great as well Will definitely repurchase , Really impressed with these my face is so smooth after one use  I typically get impatient waiting 1020 minutes to take a mask off so I was hooked when I saw it was 1 minute and they defiantly didnt disappoint , These are really quiet awesome and nifty I bought both versions because these are honestly super affordable and interesting  The packaging is really organized and layered nicely  It has a secure seal on it to avoid it drying out and keep it sanitary and it has stiffer edges to keep the masks in place  The masks are a little bit of a shrunken sizes but thats because youre supposed to stretch the mask to fit your face as the instructions say  Its really easy to stretch over where you need it to  They have a really nice light scent thats barely there and they are actually nourishing to the skin and the serum sinks right in once the mask is off  The avocado is definetly soothing too These would be super awesome for travel or in your purse or as gifts or just your own personal stash for super affordable prices  You can definitely leave these on for longer than one minute too if youre wanting to They arent quiet the same as the single sheet masks from Sephora which have more serum in them but the price difference is pretty big considering you get 14 masks in one package I highly recommend these and I really hope they make more because theyre really great , Love the concept of these a quick pick me up but unfortunately a little awkward The eye holes are shaped differently small and are spaced closer together The mouth hole is quite small but not super terrible and the overall face coverage isnt there Theyre cute but I like the originals much better , Giving 5 stars because I dont hold the greatest amount of stock in sheet masks and these do the trick quite nicely Super convenient very nice gift idea and affordable for the amount you get There isnt an over abundance of serum on it hence why they may say its only a one minute mask I kept it on for about 5 minutes and used the jade roller on top My skin does feel soft and supple after use Would recommend Also eye holes are a little small be prepared , For those who love sheet masks but dont have the time to regularly enjoy them this product might make a nice compromise Dont kid yourself tho this is not going to be as luxurious as most sheet masks that youre going to leave on for 20 minutes as it doesnt have anywhere near the same amount of serum Where this mask excels is in the convenience when time is limited When I first used it I didnt give it a fair chance as I was rushed and only used a makeup remover cloth the previous evening To make it worse that morning I only did a prep of a brief wiping from a warm washcloth no cleansers The mask was much dryer than the usual sheet masks the holes were a little small for my face I also felt a temporary mild burning on the edge of my upper lip Probably left it on for a few extra minutes while I was busy getting ready for work but my face wasnt left sticky like typical sheet masks meaning less time having to be spent massaging the excess serum into the skin With no time to put on makeup I went to work initially underwhelmed by the mask experience until I saw how fresh and bright my skin looked once I got there WOW Normally I have to wear at least a tinted moisturizer or some mineral makeup to brighten my face to the same level as this mask Im going to add this combo warm washcloth and mask as another one of my minimalist skincare options when Im short on time Im sure the results would be even nicer bundled with cleanser moisturizer and makeup , Ive used these for a week now and only use them in the morning They go on nicely and the scent is light They are not as hydrating as I would have liked them to be I use this after I wash my face I was hoping to use this instead of a moisturizer to speed up my morning routine Unfortunately I still have to moisturize I like the concept of a 1 min sheet face mask so Im hopeful that there will be a product out there soon For now I wont be purchasing again , Love these Super cute gift idea and super easy to use I especially love using it with a facial roller My skin feels super soft glowy and hydrated The scent is light so it doesnt give me any headaches and they are super quick to use I like to leave mine on for longer than suggested just because I feel like the serum absorbs in better but when I want my skin to look good quick this is what I like to use , the eye and mouth holes are weirdly spaced and the mask "
3-in-1 Extractor Tool,"This product gets the job done However I feel like I bought the same one several years ago and it used to be more heavy duty  , I use this on my skin reset days When I use this tool and do my skin care my nose feels so smooth Gets the job done I just feel like you could get a tool like this for cheaper , Has been very useful Lance is very sharp Havent had any problems and my boyfriend loves it , easily rusted and the tip of the tool isnt sharp enough for extraction , Ive had this for over a year now and its survived 8 moves great quality and it actually does its job has helped my skin with blackheads and pimples so much plus its satisfying , Its useful and the lance part is very sharp Not my favorite but it gets the job done , I have previously purchased several of the the 3in 1 Extractor Tools for myself and others  It was black and angled at the small end  It was great and worked very well  This one is flat  Its awful and doesnt work nearly as well  I wish Sephora would bring the black kind back  This one is more like the one I got at Ulta which I promptly returned and came back to Sephora to get the black one , Jignore si je lutilise de la bonne faon mais je fais plus de marque sur ma peau que si sutilise tout simplement mes doigts , Good quality for price but does not work well on blackheads which is what I bought it for , This tool works amazingly well its easy to use and to keep clean and it is better than just using your fingers It can be addictive and if you overdue it you will tear up your skin so only use it on pores that clearly need it and not on every little pore you can see and youll be all set , This tool is good for the price It worked well to remove some small blackheads on my nose but it definitely isnt the best quality out there I tried this one on a whim because I was curious about the difference in quality compared to my current one the same one used in office where I work This tool wont be effective on total and proper extraction of a pimpleblackhead Its important to educate yourself on how to use this tool properly because improper use can have a negative affect on your skin Overall Id say its great for simple extractions but be careful with how you use this tool and research as much as you can before using it And of course if you are going to be extracting make sure your face and hands are clean and the tool is sanitized And follow your extraction with a skin care regimen You dont want to remove all that gunk from your face just to get it dirty again And wash your face regularly This tool should not replace good face washingRated 3 stars because on one hand its great to have on hand for smaller blackhead and pimple concerns and the price is decent for what you get But on the other hand its definitely a lower grade quality so you wont be getting as good of a result as you would with a sharper tool and Im worried about anyone causing more damage to their skin , This was great for very large pimples not so good for smaller ones , I wish I waited to purchase before seeing the last review because I completely agree  this is waaaay less sharp than I imagined it would be Calling it sharp at all would be generous It barely pierces the skin Like the other reviewer Im scared it might cause more damage than a sharp needle , I like the blackhead extractor The needle to pop the pimple however it not at all sharp and would do more damage to my skin compared to using a pointyer needle , Addicting so be careful using this I mostly use this on my nose and when I have menstrual acne that needs to be drained I have had estheticians show me how they use these tools but if you YouTube it it really is simple When I say be careful you really shouldnt go hard all over your face or chest because you can scar especially if you havent been trained like me haha But if you get white heads or pesky blackheads on your nose this works amazing especially with acids , This thing rules Easy to disinfect and it helps pop everything , Didnt work for me I feel it didnt take out much , Amazing tool If you have closed comedonesclogged pores they need to be extracted It wont go away with a topical product like a cystic pimple would This extractor has been amazing at clearing up my texture and getting rid of all my clogged pores Super easy to use and easy to clean , This is a great extractor tool Not sure if someone got a defective one but mine is very sturdy and useful Love the needle addition , This is a piece of garbage The first time I went to use it and used the small side to try to make an extraction the end broke right off without me even pressing hard at all Just broke right off Waste of money"
4 Piece Facial Razor Set,"These honesty dont work they just scratch your face , I like these razors for a quick way to clean up and tidy up my brow hairs If you just need a minor clean up time to time these are great , Not sharp at all compare to the no brand I ordered from Amazon , Perfect for the top of my brows and side of my face It does the job , Not very sharp so doesnt work great Felt I had to use it every few days because the hair was never getting shaved nicely , They work but are pretty scratchy and easy to cut yourself I have better luck with a cheap single bladed mens razor I like the handle shape though and its easier to get closer to your hairline or in between your eyebrows with these , Looks exactly like the picture Works really good and it is large so it take less time than the Walmart one ahah , My go to facial razor when dermaplaning User friendly safe clean cute colours available and affordable Always ensure to use a facial serum or jelly prior to and it will leave the skin silky smooth , Not bad not great Cute colours and would probably buy again The blade isnt great , I used these for dermaplaning and it worked out really well for me I do always recommend putting on some sort of thick jelly on before this helps to leave a softer finish I used the lite sauce for item beauty but you can use something like Vaseline too If you just use these on dry skin they can skid but they arent very sharp so they wont cut or get off all of the hair Overall great product for the price , These work but theres like gapped plastic film that makes it not as close as youd like Id go with a better brand with no film Wouldnt buy again but works , The old version with the the darker coloured razors were way better These dont even compare to those these just dont work well at all Cant get as close to my eye brow with these either Doesnt take all the peach fuzz off Going to try the metal one and hope that one compares to the old version of these , They work but become dull after a few uses Good and reliable , Not worth it Its not good material and too harsh on skin  The hair grows weird afterwards  Do not waste your money on this item , After using this I got a lot of breakouts Im not sure whether it is just a coincidence OR whether removing the hair from your face exposes your skin and makes it more prone to acne It definitely takes the fuzz off but Im not sure this is necessary to do People have said to use it with oil and then some said to use it without Giving it 3 stars because it is just OK but maybe there is no need to shave your face unless you absolutely have a lot of visible hair and are of darker complexion , These shavers are handy and can be packed in any to go bag with ease however they are alittle painful to use and tend to have some sharp edges so be very careful my baby fuzz shaver friends , I have used these MANY times and highly recommend Theyre nice  sharp  last many uses before having to dispose of them I honestly prefer these over the SC refillable razors Theyre a great price and work super well for shaving anywhere on your faceneck I usually use them when Im in the bath splash water on my face and shave the entire surface of my face I am super sensitive and have never experienced any issues using these , These razors are just okay Be careful if you have sensitive skin it made me break out , Do it yourself dermaplane what could possibly be bad about that , Very confused by the reviews saying these arent sharp cause I accidentally cut my palm on one of these lol No these are amazing when you use them at an angle like on your face its sharp but not like dangerously sharp Easily shaved the peach fuzz on my face , These are very nice facial razors I use them to remove the peach fuzz from my face to allow my serums to penetrate better Additionally I use them to shape my eyebrows , They dont cut your hairs but boy can they cut your face , I have been buying these for years the old version and now the new ones they are sharp and they do a terrific job for their intended purpose , Im not sure what all the bad reviews are for I use these on my face and in the down there areas to get in the little cracks and crevices that my razor didnt fully smooth over or cant rully reach and they do a GREAT job I have thick Mediterranean body hair and it leaves nothing behind , This was a repurchase for me I wish these ones came with refills They get thr job done in 4 pastel colours Value for money is good , I see reviews saying theyre not sharp Well I must not be experienced because I bought and used these and I cut my face Otherwise they certainly did the job I dunno if Id use these again , Not sharp They just pull the hair out Had cheaper ones from Amazon that did a much better job They look cute though , Used for my first time trying dermaplaning and I was shocked how much fine hair it removed Ive been using 12 times per week and its now more noticeable how much dry skin this removes as well I only do this after a hot shower in front of a 10x magnify mirror and follow with my skincare routine My hairs are not coming in any darker and I wish I had started using these a long time ago Totally impressed with how smooth my liquid foundation applies now , Did not work at all Couldnt even remove peach fuzz , So quick and easy to use for eyebrow cleanups Ive even gotten my Mum hooked on using these haha , Super good quality razors that glided nicely across my skin Got rid of all my peach fuzz and had no resulting knicks or cuts , Love these they get my face super smooth Only draw back I wish the tip was rounded instead of pointy and sharp Gotta be careful on what angle youre using it Otherwise great tool , I was using some facial razors from amazon for a few years but decided I wanted to spend a little more money and try these facial razors And holy cow what a huge difference It gets a closer shave is easier to use and doesnt knick anywhere They are small enough and thin enough to get into smaller spaces on your face and avoid making a mistake around your eyebrows The only thing that was an adjustment was that since it is a better razor it was harsh on my upper lip as opposed to my other dull razors So my upper lip was a little painful to do but other than that I love these , Great accurate razor set Pretty colors  Make great stoking stuffers , I loved these until I cut my face with it So I guess if youre clumsy , Love these They are sharp and effective and a great value , Theyre fine they get the job done for quick facial hair removal Ive used better but dont want to pay such a high price for better so these are fine I dont recommend for sensitive skin as other reviews have mentioned they can scratch a bit some inconsistency from one blade to the next , Ive been using these razors for several years now to remove peach fuzz and also for other little touch ups on my legs theres always that one spot you miss These work well and are a good price They really do help with exfoliating and leave my skin very smooth without irritation I do apply an oil make up remover before using though dont use these dry My peach fuzz has not grown back any darker or thicker Its exactly the same as its been since high school These arent the best facial razors Ive used the now impossible to find noxema razors with a completely smooth blade are the best but very good , Ive tried other facial razors previously but these are the only ones that never cut my face They are perfect , These are awful Dont waste your money The blades are so dull , These razors do the job if you want to touch up your eyebrows  shape them However if youre considering using these for facial peach fuzz they are harsh on the skin so wouldnt recommend for that use  Overall an almost okay razor , Silly purchase serrated edge is really a lousy design  Dont waste your money , great product works really well and is super simple to use definitely recommend , not sharp at all just scratch the skin and thats it need to go over and over again to remove hair , Its amazing and came on time Furthermore it got rid of all my facial hair although I did get minor cuts Its very sharp but besides that I love it , Definitely not as sharp as previous versions  had to do two passes but still much cheaper than the other Sephora options , I decided to buy these facial razor set after reading all the great reviews I absolutely love it It removes peach fuzz and dead skin effortlessly My skin looks and feels amazing , No these are not very sharp The Japanese steel blade ones were so good At first use of these was like the 10th use on the former blades you all use to sell Not sharp enough for contouring , These are not ergonomic and dull Twinkle facial razors are by far better , These changed significantly from the old ones Before they changed them up they were amazing These new ones are not sharp at all and barely did anything at all , Love it I pray I can get new replacement blades Great product Nice and easy to use Smooth handle and nice design , did absolutely nothing  does not remove hair or peach fuzz , So good for the price work really well I use them about three times each for my face and after that I use them only for my brows since they arent as sharp , Absolutely terrible Not sharp at all Would not recommend to anyone , Love these great price point and work well Gently exfoliated my skin while removing hairs , wowwhat a smooth feeling these leave you with but te breakout aftermath was enough to make me never use them again , These are awful They do not go over your face smoothly I have used many other dermaplane razors before without any issue These cut up my face I would not recommend these at all Very disappointed , Very economic and does the jobVery happy with the product , Works good  1st time using from sephora razors I just hope they dont dull quick like others in the past , Ive been buying these and the other ones they had before these and Im OBSESSED with them and for the price its a good deal  , I have used your old razors for years and recommended them to ALL my friendsI was SO disappointed with the new razors Do not work nearly as well as the old ones The old razors were so much sharper and way better Please change them backthey were awesome before , I bought the new Sephora razor set thinking it was of the same quality as the old ones but was very dissatisfied They are not as sharp as the old ones therfore not as effective I would never purchase again Dont waste your money , Works well and worth the price Glad I tried Sephoras and will buy again , They were okay some of them scratched my face though I do prefer my Tinkle ones but these do in a pinch , Completely sliced my face I moisturized prior to using and it still cut me in 4 places also no cover at the end of the razor to protect from cuts if used at the wrong angle , I love these razors I hope they restock soon I use them in between my facials they can be used at least 4 times each Id say Also good for shaving hairs on tattoos Obviously not the greatest but for the price you cant beat it , Love the handle I use this on my face for a quick refresher or to prep before makeup , Love these razors Theyre life savers especially now that all salons are closed and I cant get waxed Theyre also perfect for a little eyebrow shaping or getting rid of your moustache the last minute Extremely sharp tho I have cut my face before when I was trying to go fast The pack will last you a while , I purchased these not expecting much but was surprised at how sharp they actually are Be mindful of this because I cut my face multiple times just by placing the razor angled These do the job and are reasonable priced , Works well but not as sharp as the old set of three Sephora used to make , Its the pandemic We cant get our brows waxed Im guilty for abusing my eyebrows with any old eyebrow razors I can pick up at the dollar store So let me tell you this Stop doing that and stop leaving a mess for when the pandemic stops because your beautician will hate you Get theseEven my nervefried hands love these The blade is huge and daunting but you can get into small areas of your brows These are sharp but they didnt leave my combination skin too raw which is a miracle because my brows and eyelids are often the most dryBest results came using a toner before using the razor and applying moisturizer after The shave was nice and I didnt have to pluck except for two hairs after Now Ive kept up my eyebrowsPrice cannot be beat and I didnt feel like I was sawing away at a stalk of hair or at my skin One swipe and done Ill take itand forget this happened when I can wax again , great absolutely love them worked great no tugging of the skin no irritation no redness and took care of peach fuzz dry skin now my makeup goes on smoothly , This is amazing Not only is a good shave it does get rid of those dead skin cells It left my skin SUPER soft Plus it helped me tame my brows back to where I wanted them to be the pandemic has not been kind to them Would recommend  this might be one of the best value and favorite things Ive bought from Sephora , Is this really meant to be a facial razor It gave me razor burns and rashes on my face Very disappointed  , These are amazing A great price Ive bought multiple brands This is by far my favorite"
AHA Peeling Masks,"I really liked this product the label didnt come with instructions so I had to look on the product description here but in case you dont already know you only leave it on for 10 minutes Dont be like the girl leaving a bad review because she left it on for a half hour It is a skin peeling mask do not leave it on longer than it is intended if used properly it yields lovely results , I use this on my arms for my KP It helps I also use it on my face occasionally but I dont have as much texture or other issues there 30 ml isnt a lot for use on the body but it is very inexpensive I would buy again It is gentle no stinging no dramatic results but over time with consistent use you see them , Good product I saw result after first mask love them , I think it could have ended up being very beneficial for my skin but it did not tore me how long to keep in on so a half hour later I wiped if of and had red skin Do not recommend , was sent an unboxed and broken seal product possibly a display item not sure of location havent tried product yet but disappointed from lack of product safety customer useWas also not sent the 2 samplers that were chosen , I used this product 2 x per week It leaves the skin smooter and refreshed It is not peel of you have to wash it , Very bad It doesnt peel or even clean No glowing or any of the stuff mentioned , I felt no change in my skin Not smoother at all and no visible different either I have been using this 23X a week for a month now Also there felt like there was no physical mask More like a serum almost , not sure as I have tried so many products lately but no bad reaction and I have super sensitive skin , love this product so much it makes my skin so nice after one use you can already see a difference definitely recommend , this is not a peeling mask as advertised disappointed , no all these reviews are complaining bc this isnt a peeloff mask but this mask works SO well i liked the ordinarys ahabha mask but i LOVE this its so gentle it doesnt sting when you put it on and you can see and feel the results right after using it im in love , Honestly this AHA peeling mass and papaya is great for just a cleanser by itself It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and the rough texture that I used to have prior to using this is no longer a problem I recommend this for anyone that needs something a little different than your average cleanser , Those who are disappointed by this mask are just not understanding the difference between a peeling mask and a peeloff mask This peeling mask is gentle just I do see a slight difference after use , This product had my skin feeling soft and smooth I will try it  AGAIN , I thought it was a peeling mask but its more like an rince off mask be careful it can burn the skin a bit when you apply it but its still a very good product , Doesnt peel like the title so its disappointing and the smell isnt great , not good didnt do anything dosent peel not worth the price is also really small , Not helping beneficial It just make you feel freshI was expecting a real peeling mask this is like sticky mask which need to be washed with water , hate this let it sit on my face for over an hour hoping it would dry up like a peel mask is supposed to and it never did turned the consistency of hair gel , I bought this on a whim during the sale as it was so dead cheap My skin is pretty resilient so I have actually been using this product everyday as a face wash instead of a mask I put it on in the shower and then wash it off after Im done showering Its kept my skin in check and has not irritated it at all since its so gentle For the price point I honestly recommend grabbing one and trying it Im gonna buy a few more since it says its a limited product offeringnot sure for how long though , love it  it works exactly like the green apple peel by juice beauty smells great as wwll , I do think this product made my skin softer How we I was hoping for a nice fruity scent and this has no smell whatsoever I was also unsure how to use it before I realized you need to peel the label off to see the directions , I bought this on a whim during the VIB Rouge sale not expecting much because of the price point but I honestly LOVE it so far Its super gentle so can be used as a maskpeel 3x a week it leaves my skin feeling smoother and it doesnt tight or burn or agitate my redness so I think itd honestly work well for anyone with sensitive skin And the pricepoint You really cant beat it , This stuff is amazing Leaves my skin touchably smoother and fresh For the price I reccomend this to everyone , Isnt a peel off mask as advertised The mask doesnt even dry completely which is pretty disappointing considering its literally advertised as a peeling mask The pictures also make the packaging look bigger than it is However it left my skin glowing and fresh Really recommend if you have dryer skin , By peeling I was expecting this mask to perform at some level like an at home AHA peel Not sure what exact AHA percentage this mask is but it does nothing Even with a 15 or so mask Id expect some tingling but there is nothing Was trying to find a cheap acid peel but this is not it , I hope they keep this product instead of having it as limited edition My skin felt so smooth and glowing after Great product , It does sever its purpose if we look at the price but its not what I thought the way it names peeling masks its not peeling mask at all It dont get dry you need to set alarm to remember to wash your face  , It smells amazing and is very easy to apply My face looks amazing after I use it , I just used the papaya mask for the first time and I wanted to see if the resurfacing of the skin really happened to me This product feels like a thin liquidlike gel and a little goes a long way so I wanted to see how good it would work only using the bare minimum amount less than 1 pump I was also unsure if this is a PEELING mask as in it peels off or as in it exfoliates Well it is not a peel off mask and it seemed to smooth my skin I didnt expect a miracle in one use but its gentle enough to use 23 times a week if used properly Definitely worth the buy for 10 , This stuff is amazing I find it really hydrates and keeps my skin glowing I bought the papaya scent and would like to try the others , This is fantastic Its gentle enough that even with my sensitive skin it doesnt sting or burn Maybe just a slight tingle and thats all Its so easy to use and leaves my skin noticeably smoother And its a really great price , This is a must have Instant glow and smoothing of the skin Its not your typical peeling mask you dont peel it off you wash it off but it does help with hyper pigmentation and skin texture , Great mask but it doesnt peel so it feels kinda deceitful It still worked ok but just wasnt what it said it was , Recieved it today and used it right away Left my son feeling fresh and smooth has an excellent smell to it However it does not peel like what I expected Still a great product Definitely recommend , Such cute packaging and even cuter results I really enjoyed this product and definitely have noticed a radiance after 2 uses I have sensitive skin and so far have had no issues , Love the smell  the end result I have this 4 stars though because it doesnt peel off like your typical peeling mask , I bought the papaya oneit doesnt have that smell but its ok I still have it 5 stars because it does what it says it smooths your skin I thought it was going to be one of those masks that you can peel but no you have to wash it offI hope I see a difference over time"
Acne Treatment Gel,I wanted to test this out for a little bit before writing my review I am pleasantly surprised In the beginning for every blemish this took away new one would appear But I can honestly say this is keeping my skin in really good condition I have sensitive skin and this is very gentle My skin flare ups are more hormonal and this is a must have in my arsenal
All Day Hyaluronic Acid Hydrator Moisturizer,"Its very moisturizing and doesnt cause me to break out Its doesnt burn or cause redness either Overall it was a nice moisturizer for the price Does everything you need it to I dont have any complaints , When I bought this my skin was super dry and I tried so many things and nothing worked This all day hydrator helped me so much I use it under my makeup as a primer and at night its so multi purpose and its my favorite  It also doesnt mess my makeup Also I feel like this is much more useful for drier skin because its more on the greasier side It also leaves a beautiful glow on the skin I love the price and I will be repurchasing again , My favorite moisturizer Works well under every foundation I own Works well with other brand serums This I must always have , I really like the consistency of this cream Its light and absorbs well Unfortunately had to discontinue using it as my makeup separates immediately with this on This happens a lot with my concealer and different moisturizers so it might just be me , I had high hopes that this would solve my unending search for the perfect moisturizer for my combo oily skin but unfortunately it was a miss for me Lightweight but def had a greasy texture and did not provide a great base for makeup , My holy grail moisturizer I will forever repurchase I havent tried using it under makeup but I keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day No scent whatsoever and it doesnt burn any eczema I may have , Its very hydrating even living in a dry environment I wont be repurchasing because it has a strange smell almost like burnt plastic They have other moisturizers that work just as well with no weird smell , This is the best face moisturizer I have ever used it is everything I wish it a came in a larger size and b that that larger size cost as much as this teeny size , I love this product I have used it for several weeks and I have noticed better hydration during  the winter months , This product is awesome  one of the most affordable and hydrating hyaluronic products Ive used It has a slightly cooling effect when applied  I use it daily with a face oil after and its kept my skin plump and hydrated Love it , i have dry skin and it keeps me moisturized i have been using this for at least 2 years doesnt break me out or anything smell is a little bit weird but nothing too bad worth it , Smells like its prescription creams and not silky smooth like other product but it works if you need something natural and cost effective Works best applied twice daily , They changed the formula Its thick and not as moisturizing as the previous one , Great price and extra points for being clean and reasonably priced Would recommend if youre looking for a simple hydrating moisturizer but not if youre looking for something to minimize wrinkles or fine lines , Ive been using this for several weeks and its become my goto moisturizer It leaves my skin looking and feeling hydrated and soft It moisturizes my dry skin and helps reduce the appearance of the lines around my mouth The consistency is perfect  making it easy to apply and absorb quickly I also love that it comes in a tube for easy application , first I thought it was me but now Im reading other reviews and realizing it truly smells horrible I thought it smelled RANCID which made me upset and nervous it was super old I cant see myself continue using it due to smell , Its been 2 days so far I purchased this face cream I got it as a suggestion along with a cleanser and serum because I been breaking out Now I love the fact it give a beautiful glow which is my biggest goal in skincare I have used other creams like the ordinary with HYA in it and I liked it but this right here was the win for me its not greasy my skin actually feels baby soft which I never experienced before on my face not sticky or greasyoily I have drycombo skin only downfall sofar is 24 for 50ml the size of my hand but you pay for what you get so I mean in another sense its worth the 24 just gotta purchase frequently if used 2x a day I found it had lasted me all day without feeling gross or feeling the need to reapply I use morning and night to start and end my day with my routine ALSO It says its odorless but does have a little smell but could just be the ingredients not a strong smell but definitely not unscented  PROSHYDRATINGGLOW IN SKIN NOT SHINY WHERE IT LOOK OILY LASTS ALL DAY as mentioned on bottleBABY SKIN TEXTURENOT GREASY A LITTLE STICKY WHEN APPLIED AT FIRST BUT WHEN DRIES LEAVES A SMOOTH DEWY DRY THO BABY LIKE TEXTURE DOESNT AGGRIVATE ACNE GOOD FOR USE IF YOU BREAKING OUTCONS 2400 CAD FOR 50ML But u get worth the money just gotta repurchase often LIGHTLY SCENTED BUT NOTHING OVER POWERING on bottle says unscentedSLIGHTLY STICKY WHEN FIRST APPLIED BUT then dries perfectly and lasts all day without going gross into oily texture when dries feels dewy like a baby foot I only gave 4 stars bcz little cons and its day 2Its worth it tho if you have combo skin Over all I like it In pics one with flash one without flash , this is average the smell indeed is horrible you can do better , To be completely honest Im not sure about this one I got a sample and absolutely loved it so I decided to purchase the large version Im not sure if its other skincare products or why this happens but ever since I got it my makeup and skin care even without makeup my skin care just rolls off Maybe my skin is peeling from other products but if this problem isnt coming from the moisturizer I absolutely LOVE it , I highly recommend this moisturizer It is a small size but you need only a pea sized amount for each use I use it twice a day and I noticed a huge improvement in my skin  it is so soft and hydrated Highly recommend , Easy to apply smooth product Fragrance free was a huge plus for me with my sensitive skin This is so nice in the winter without being too heavy , I bought this product a few years ago and I LOVED it It was lightweight and glowy I just bought it again and it seems the formula has changed It goes on thick and my skin feels dull and sticky in a weird way , Have used this for a while now and it really works for me Great product considering the price compared to other moisturizers , its average the consistency of the moisturizer is very gel like which I was not expecting Ive noticed it causes some of my serums to pill as I apply and rub it into my face will be returning , This was recommended to me by one of ladies working in Sephora And this is the best recommendation made I use this morning and night I love it , Received this as a sample in a little sample pack I absolutely love the consistency of this formula Sometimes I prefer a thick cream but today I opted for something light and this was perfect I loved how this applie to my skin I absolutely woul purchase a full size , I keep the smaller version with me all the time and got the bigger one for my mom Works great for our skin , Its way too watery Doesnt absorb into my skin PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL 30 Crme moisturizer in the tub again Tired of going on eBay and getting my favorites , Very mediocre and heavier than Id like  I tried it as a cheaper alternative to the hyaluronic cloud cream and it is nothing like it It does moisture and didnt make me break out  But my skin feels heavier , Formula is so great it keeps skin soft and hydrated throughout day and night By far best serum and first step in any skin care routine , This is by far the best moisturizer 5 stars is best way to review  , so good for my dry skin after use my skin was hydrated and plump , I was looking for an affordable and effective daily face moisturizer since the winter has drastic sucked the moisture from my face I decided to pick this up while it was 30 percent off and I can definitely sayit is amazing stuff I had to go back and buy two more My foundation sits on top of this moisturizer beautifully No need to prime And also dry patches be gone My new favorite , Coming back for my third one of these so figured Id write a review Ive tried tons of moisturizers over the years seeking something that hydrates but doesnt break me out or cause redness as I have sensitive combo skin thats prone to dry patches cystic acne and red bumps with many common skincare ingredients This works and is such a great value I travel a lot for work and I appreciate that its small enough for carryon luggage , So far so good Works well no scent Skin stays hydrated , Best bang for your dollar with this product Its works great keeping my skin bright all day , this is a really good moisturizer its very lightweight and the consistency is perfect love everything about it and definitely recommend , This is definitely a new formula than the previous one I had The moisturizer is thicker and has a weird smell compared to the last one which was a little more runny and had such a pleasant smell I definitely preferred the previous formula HOWEVER this one isnt bad Not a love but I did keep it , I like how this is lightweight but still very moisturizing I use it in the morning before applying makeup and it works very well It doesnt mess up my foundation , Got this in my advent calendar and it is amazing  ordering it already as it lasts a long time on my dry parched skin and never feels tight , This is a great lightweight moisturizer for dry skin  I love to wear it under makeup because its light and gives a good base  The smell isnt the best but its also not terrible  I can live with it as long as it does the job , Calling ALL skin types  This hydrator is AWESOME  I wear it after cleansing and before applying my foundation and BAMI am hydrated and oil free  Im 49 years old with combo skin and it works great for me  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND , Having used this for a few years now its hydrating and a great price and I wish it came in a bigger container However the new formula smells absolutely terrible , Lots of reviews about the smell and size of the product Yes this product has an odd smell  like plasticky But I can move past that and recognize that this is a great hydrating moisturizer that leaves a beautiful glowy finish to the skin At first I was shocked by how small the container was but soon found that a little goes a long way Love using on no makeup days and also find the consistency to be perfect when mixed with a tinted glow drop or foundation , smells so bad The smell is disgusting you do not want this on your skin Its too liquids it does not feel like a moisturizer and does not hydrate at all Wish I could give zero stars , This is also great to use as a primer for all my flowy gals , Smaller than expected But the worst part by far is the smell It truly smells smoky like no skincare product I have ever experienced The results were average and I dont recommend buying it , I love this product I love how glowy it makes my skin and how hydrated I feel after using it My only small complaint is that after a few hours of wear nothing else on top it peels , I looove this product Its works great moisturizes my skin makes it glow and reduces wrinkles and plumps the skin The price is great I wish there was a bigger amount option though I also have sensitive skin and it doesnt bother it at all I highly recommend it , This moisturizer makes my skin feel so clean and healthy Some moisturizers can be sticky and thick but this one is the perfect consistency I recommend this to all women into skincare I typically use with the gel and charcoal mask , If you LOVED the 3 ingredient moisturizer dont bother with this The old formula worked so well for my acne scars and kept acne at bay This new formula is terrible It pills easily with or without makeup It feels like it is sliding off my face and my face breaks out horribly now Please bring back the original 3 ingredient moisturizer , Product does keep my skin from drying out however it feels very heavy on my face and I really dont like that feeling Not for me , This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee several years ago and Ive used it ever since I absolutely love this moisturizer I occasionally try out others when I get a gift or sample but none are as wonderful as this one And its incredibly affordable I cant recommend this enough It goes perfectly under my spf and primer and doesnt leave my skin feeling oily or dry , I really wanted to like this product But it definitely broke me out It broke me out in cystic pimples will be returning it , Love love love love this moisturizer since my face is dry  sensitive best for morning  night  a good primer for makeup  , This moisturizer is lovely Its lightweight yet makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated I use it both morning and night and Ive notice my dry skin is so much better Even my neck area is more hydrated because of this And its a holy grail for its price point A must have for me , I love this hydrator moisturizer it makes my skin feel healthy and hydrated , Moisturizing I love this cream Its great for oily skin and pairs perfectly with your makeup Its super lightweight and provides muchneeded hydration for the day Overall I love it and I would definitely recommend this , Used it for 7 days and I see a difference My skin is soft Will definitely buy again and recommend this product , Estoy tan contenta con esta crema que compre ms deja piel suave pero no grasosa me da la hidratacin que necesito la uso en mis clientas y en todo tipo de piel y me va sper bien sin duda alguna la volver a comprar , Absolutely loved this product from the first use I waited a bit to make Sue I enjoyed it but my face felt very nice and smooth when using it I used it in the morning sometimes even to prime my face and it did very well to last , This is my second bottle and after using it for some time I can genuinely feel my skin feeling more hydrated and plumed I sometimes mix my foundation in with this primer for a more glowy and dewy finish and it works beautifully , Get it works great on dry skin Im a woman of color , Bought this just to try a new moisturizer because Im incredibly acne prone and OMG  I cant believe how good it is Doesnt leave me greasy but gives me a glow Doesnt make me breakout and the price is right Wish it had a larger bottle but Ill never use any other moisturizer ever again , I loved it Went to Sephora asking for cheaper moisturizer and they gave me this I was using tatcha water cream before and this is similar , I really enjoy how it feels on my skin since I started using itMy skin felt very moisturized since the day one , This is just a straight up nice day time moisturizer Nothing fancy but I love it Sometimes I use this sometime tatcha dewy skin This has a thin consistency similar to Glossier and leaves the skin dewy and hydrated all day I keep coming back for to repurchase , The formula is amazing so smooth and lightweight my only reason I have to give a 4 is because the bottle isnt so good Since its a very liquidy moisturizer and it leaks easily and the product is everywhere when you open it I loose so much product  wish it was a pump style , Amazing product Hydration Makes my skin so smooth and soft Dont need much each application Buuut I did wish the bottle was bigger for 17 Great quality just wish I got more especially since its Sephora brand , wasnt expecting much from this moisturizer but omg its one of the best ive ever used i suffered from horribly textured skin and this has helped completely smooth my skin out i cant recommend more the hyaluronic acid does WONDERS this moisturizer is great to apply before primerfoundation buying a 2nd bottle soon , Been using this product for less than a week and I already see a difference in my skin I do use my normal moisturizer after applying this and my skin has never felt so good , Super impressed with this Nice and lightweight better than drugstore quality products at a similar price This is a great alternative to a gel moisturizer for summer if youre like me and gel lotions cause your makeup to run , I like it but wish it was a matte finish It is a little watery so be careful when you squeeze the tube , I LOVE this moisturizer and for the price you cant go wrong I have comboacne prone skin and Ive had no reaction or breakouts using this It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and the nice thing about it for those who dont love using a primer it does a good job acting as that as well It does leave you feeling ever so slightly tacky so I give it time to settle in before applying makeup but Ive had no issues as long as I let it settle first , This is my goto daily moisturizerI just restocked last week probably at least my tenth tube Sadly I immediately noticed when I used it today that the consistency was thicker and the smell is different Both negative changes for me personally Please change it back , Product was not as smooth as I anticipated I felt like my skin was protected but I also broke out a few times not sure if it was because of the product itself , It does a good job of hydrating and you need way less than you think Not a fan of the smell but it doesnt stick around so not that big of a deal Probably wont end up being my goto moisturizer but its a decent reasonably priced option , Decent product but you lose 60 of it because of the terrible packaging itself it spills like everywhere u barely need to squeeze it then capping it the cap falls off 3 times Very cheap terrible packaging idk do better sephora , This is a nice medium weight moisturizer that feels good on the face and layers well under makeup  It is affordably priced made with clean ingredients and would work well for people with most skin types , I love this moisturizer and it has quickly become my favorite It is lightweight and absorbs fast and doesnt leave you feeling sticky It doubles as a primer and pairs well with both my foundation and BB cream I also love the dewy glow it gives my skin after I put it on , Ive been using this product as a primer it pairs well with the foundations I have , This moisturizer is really light and hydrating It doesnt have much of a scent which I appreciate Its also clean and vegan which I try to incorporate into my skincare routine  Its also pretty affordable too , I love this Instant holy grail for my red acne prone dry skin Amazing Even for a dry rashy patch on my neck Run dont walk to buy this affordable gem Better than many expensive hydrators , When I tried this I was pretty surprised I have extremely sensitive skin and I dont change my face cream ever This was light and did not break me out which was great This cream is also very affordable , My go to moisturizer I have super dry skin and this helps it so much I use it for a primer for my makeup because my skin gets patchy with any foundation specially in the winter so this really takes away any patchy skin when I use it under my makeup I like pairing it with rose hip seed oil when using it during my skincare routine , Loving this moisturizer It feels fantastic on my skin and hydrates my dry complexion It makes my skin so soft glow and radiant I would purchase this again and recommend to my friends This is great day or night and is easy to travel , Absolutely adore this cream Theres a reason why it is always out of stock at the store So good for dry skin the formula makes it so that the Hyaluronic acid doesnt make my skin even more dry I live in a very dry climate and so typical HA makes my skin more dry  Highly recommend , I would not reccomend this moisturizer The moisturizer feels like a normal everyday moisturizer from the drugstore for like 8 bucks For reference my routine is cleanser a hydrating toner serum a face oil and this moisturizer The moisturizer does not last for longer than a few hours even when kayered with other hydrating productsI take care to introduce products one at a time and give them the best shot at working I even switched from my salicylic acid cleanser to my hylauronic acid cleanser and it STILL did not come close to being as moisturizing as claimed  The fact that this teeny moisturizer does not keep my skin moisturized after a hydrating toner and a hydrating face oil shows me that its not very effective , Amazing hydrator that is made with clean ingredients

far its been doing the job I would recommend for quality but not so much for scent , First time trying a Sephora brand facial product and it was ok For the cost I felt slighted by the size as its far smaller than I expected It moisturized the skin decently however so I do encourage for people to try the product at least The price point needs to be improved to reflect the size of the product , I

morning as a primer before my makeup and keeps my makeup looking fresh and smooth , Love this as my everyday hydrator I often use it as a primer and its super light weight The price is very affordable for the quality of the product This is definitely going to be my goto everyday , I love this lightweight moisturizer for everyday wear Its perfect for my sensitive acneprone skin and is vegan and part of the Clean at Sephora collection Im also a fan of the low price compared with similar moisturizers while still being a quality moisturizer Although the packaging is a cheaper lightweight plastic  I actually love the matte feel of the container because it is easier to open and close when you have lotion on your hands Overall a simple and sensitive daily face lotion thats easy on your wallet , This all day hydrator with hyaluronic acid and vitamin E hydrates skin for up to 8 hours and protects your skin from environmental damage , Hyaluronic acid is a staple in my skincare routine I never

Best Sellers Set,"Ive been using this product for a couple months and am out of it best purchase ever with the price and how it really kept my skin clear and softWill be repurchasing right now , Purchased this on a whim while traveling because I needed a cleanser turned to be such a win because it also came with a moisturizer and serum Cleanser did a good job at removing makeup little goes a long way The moisturizer was lightweight and didnt clog my pores , Since Ive gotten bangs my forehead has been greasy while my cheeks remain dry Throw in larger pores and skin thats in its 30s and I needed a new routine After only a few uses Im already noticing a difference I definitely recommend although the moisturizer isnt my absolute favorite I still prefer another brand but this absolutely saved me money regardless , I actually had decided to buy this kit because I happen to be a super huge fan of the cleanser and moisturizer within it so I figured that the Targeted Pores Serum within it as well would make a really awesome addition to my skincare regimen too I honestly must say every product that I have ever tried from the Sephora collection thus far I really love and will most definitely repurchase for sure The cleanser that comes inside of this kit is the absolute best that I have ever tried Matter of fact it is the only cleanser that I currently use to wash my face with and the only one that I will continue to use as long as Sephora keeps selling it period The moisturizer is great and doesnt leave my face an oily mess like a lot of moisturizers do It also doesnt major clog my pores either And the serum is fantastic for helping to fight acne it also provides greater clarity and brightness to ones overall complexion and it greatly helps to reduce the look of enlarged pores and to help keep ones pores better decongested as well Plus none of these products have synthetic fragrances in them that could be possibly harmful to my skin None of them are irritating to my skin either and the serum is truly light enough to use both day and night as it will not cause any issues with your makeup at all Also based upon your skin type you can customize how you use the products in the kit to best suit your own skins individual needs You dont always have to use the moisturizer over the serum as you can just choose to use the serum without any moisturizer applied on top or on some days you can just apply the moisturizer next after cleansing your face You dont necessarily have to use the serum and moisturizer in the kit together twice a day just make sure to properly access what your skin needs on a daytoday basis and go with that Now no matter if you are a teenager or adult I cant recommend enough that you give this kit a try for sure , I bought this thinking it would be a good basic skin care for a decent price I accidentally bought 2  I blame the button masking on my end  and after a full bottle of everything I didnt really notice anything special , After using Drunk Elephant for almost 5 years my skin definitely became acclimated and it was time for a new skincare line I always look at reviews because hello Who wants to waste their money This skincare line is clean its affordable and it WORKS My skin is combo but its been super oily lately I absolutely love how quickly this has worked to close my pores and minimized my comedonal acne Goodbye Drunk Elephant hello Sephora Collection"
Black Obsidian Face and Body Gua Sha,"Please bring this back I love it so muchI hold so much tension in my jaw and using this as a massage tool helps to release it I also like the cool obsidian glass , Thankfully it arrived unbroken but I will warn everyone that you must be careful with any Gua Sha as they are very fragile I highly recommend them though very cooling and relaxing for the face My face is less puffy , I am going to be honest I did not buy this because I think it will do one darn thing to improve my wrinkles or skin tone or whatever else people think this can do for the appearance of their skin I got this because I have issues with tension in my jaw and wanted a tool to help me do self massage and relieve tension in my jaw and neck This tool is amazing for that SO I cannot say I recommend it for its intended use because I know it wont do anything to improve wrinkles or skin texture or tone long term but its GREAT for self massaging your face and neck , Super duper upset about how fragile it is barely used it and it broke after coming into contact with my sink What a shame really hoping I can get a refund or replacement of some kind but by seeing some of the other reviews looks like I wont  , An absolute favourite I built a little morning self care routine around this tool The face massage has helped reverse some of the early lines on my face Im 41 The lymphatic drainage from my faceneck massage helps with my year around allergies and I run the tool along my lats which helps loosen my thighs post knee injury My boyfriend and I frequently do massage on each others back and thats amazing too considering were far from trained professionals The tool is of perfect size to have a good grip on it and the several edge options are great for the massages mentioned above I dont spend a lot of time on those routines but certainly upgrades my life , I love this Gua Sha it is large enough to hold in your hand and do some shaping to your face and body  It is a nice weight and just glides over my skin , Its the best gua sha Ive ever had Great size easy to use but as other reviewers pointed out its also SUPER fragile If you drop it even once its game over Im on my second because my first shattered but hoping I wont have to replace it again because I really do love it otherwise , It fell and broke into millions of pieces and got cut with the glass that bounced from the impact , Extremely fragile Sephora takes no real responsibility for how delicate this item is Will not return if broken I tried calling just after the order arrived because hitting the counter out of its packaging caused this item to shatter into a million pieces immediately , I dont know what everyone is talking about it breaking You have to keep in mind that with the gua sha technique its slippery So just be careful I spray it with rubbing alcohol and let dry after use If your only using it for the face the bumpy edge is useless  , I only had this for one day but when I used this on my face it was so relaxing I also had some tension in my neck and omg it felt sooo good when I massaged it its way bigger then I thought but I love it even more It feels heavy and luxurious , I owned this for two weeks when my cat pushed it off of a shelf very low to the ground and it shattered immediately Sure thats mostly his fault but I also see other reviews where the product has brokenshattered so the material seems to be poor quality In contrast my other gua sha Ive had for a year plus has survived a lot of falls and mistreatment in my travel bag Will be looking for a sturdier product to replace this , Worst product I have ever had it doesnt work or glide into your skin to do facial exercise Only for the show , I really liked it but like others I dropped it when using with body oil it becomes very slippery It shattered in tiny little pieces It was my own fault for dropping it but I was frustrated that the material shattered in such small shards , So relaxing worth the extra  my favorite investment in skin care and relaxation , Breaks easily I accidentally dropped it from a short distance about 6 inches high and it shattered It was nice while it lasted Not a great idea to have an easily breakable product that is meant to be used with slippery products lotionsoilsserums , love this guasha not sure if the obsidian claim is just for marketing purposes but overall super cooling and its a big step up from the small amazon guashas absolutely love im not sure if the price is very reasonable i feel as if you could get a cheaper one same size with a roller combo but its really nice either way it works best if your face is slathered in some product down to your neck and jawline have at it , So easy to use and is perfectly shapedLightwaight and the right size for the handI love it , This is my first Gua ShaIf your on the fence and a beginner just get it This is my new favorite tool I use the v shape on the end for my chin eye brows and cheek bones right center of the eyes on forehead is amazingI have been using the other textured side and flat edges on sore muscles in my arms and legs relaxing after a long day at workIm just new and Im sure when I get the techniques down I will see even more benefits All round I am so happy with this purchase definitely making me feel zen if anything else Great size too easy to hold , I have largely been using this on my face although I have tried a wholebody massage a few times It really does feel nice The short side with the v is great for moving over cheekbones or jawline and the smooth flat areas work well for applying a little pressure I should really use this more often , I shouldve known better I was careless and let it slide from my hands and dropped it and obviously it shatter in pieces and the rest was history Had to order another one because it was so good , I somewhat liked it for the two days it lasted I could see immediate results with jawline and cheekbone definition and I think it eased my undereye puffiness I might prefer a tool with fewer grooves since the scalloped edge didnt really cradle the face the way I wanted and I dont think it really added any benefits Unfortunately the gua sha shattered two days after I bought it after a very shallow drop into the sink For a tool thats used with slippery face oils and lotions I was disappointed by how fragile it was , This tool is awesome It gives a great face massage and I love the grove options for different parts of my face , Never got a chance to use this as it shattered when I dropped it Very fragile use caution when applying oillotion before using this tool , Its a LOT bigger than I expected I thought it wouldnt be good to reach small areas but the little teeth  rigged edges really help target miniscule  specific areas definitely a lot better than I expected especially at this price point Its also rigidstone like Not sure why I thought it would be of a soft texture If youre looking for a gua sha for its purpose then this is it All the other stones do the exact same thing for 5 x the price point dont get fooled , Looove it The size is perfect and the rounded edges are great for massaging different spots i only use it in my face , I absolutely love it Been using it for 3 weeks and can already see the difference in my face , I didnt look at review pictures before purchasing so I was happily surprised when I received it it is big I can see why they describe it as face and body Its large surface and the four different angles make it for a very nice experience It also has a nice weight so its not flimsy or fragile love the black color , Helped me with digestion and body sculpting Recommend using with oil , Consider the size and what youre going to be using it for It was too big for my face and neck The shape didnt work well either It appears to be glass not obsidian I was disappointed so I bought a jade one somewhere else and it works great This one would probably work well for arms legs and less curvy areas of your body , Im happy with the size shape and overall quality of this , Bigger than expected I can you use on my face and body The size also makes in easier to grip Cold to the touch like any other crystal warms with use Be gentle on your skinGreat for first time users , I havent used a facial massage product before and wanted to give this a try since my face can be puffy in the morning sometimes I dont care for the shape on my face for massage feels like maybe its too big too much hardness I thought about returning but I tried it on the back of my neck for massage  I really liked that and can see using it on my husband to give him a back massage or working out any sorenesstightness on my body , I honestly wasnt expecting the stone to be that big but i dont mind I definitely had other gua shas that feel a bit nicer on my skin different stones but its a definitely a unique shape and does its thing , Good size piece and weight I use twice daily with the Ordinary buffet serum , Worth the money This piece is very nice and large Well worth the price asked and very good quality Def would recommend , This is the only Gua Sha tool youll need The quality is just as good if not better than specialized Gua Shas that are being hyped and sold Save your money for something else and get this wonderful tool  great for both body and face , looove it use it every morning as part of my skincare routinue , I never owned a Gua sha before but this price compared to others is fantastic Ive seen how others used it and let me tell you the make of this product seems highend It feels incredible on the face and I felt so rested after using this I also used it on my hands and Just wow Great for face and body The gua sha is bigger than I was picturing and it is such a nice size to hold It also has a nice weight and overall great product to use after putting on my products to massage it in , Love it Perfect size and thickness It is real obsidian Works perfect for the jawline  cheekbones I havent tried it on my body yet but this is my go to for swelling of the face in the mornings , Awesome tool Smooth and sturdy The stone quality is great especially for the price"

Brightening Dual Facial Enzyme Exfoliator,"I love this product I have dry skin and this product is a holy grail for me It leaves a glow after each usage that i could see the difference , Product is think like mentioned below in a different review hard to squeeze out of the tube I find this to be one of the best exfoliator yet It does wonders for my skin and I can see my skin brighter Def will be buying more , got this as a gift and I really love it for my oily skin I usually dont buy Sephora brands because I thought they were made with bad ingredients but Im glad to know there are clean at Sephora things this really works well for both exfoliation physical not chemical and brightening as well I noticed other reviews said it was too thick and that it was coarse but it needs to be coarse to be a decent physical exfoliant it is thick I run out quickly but other than that I have zero complaints from my sensitive  skin I have PCOS , Sephora skin care has been really hitormiss for me and this one is a big miss Ive used this product for about a month and its doing nothing for my skin No glow no brightening My skin feels really tight immediately after using it and looks almost matte like it has completely stripped the oils from my skin Its also causing additional flakiness and redness on my cheeks and Ive never had sensitive skin I suspect the bamboo stem powder is just way too harsh for this type of application , this product was so thick it was actually hard to squeeze out of the tube and spread across face  It is coarse and rough but I found it to be brightening , Personally i really like this cleanser but it may not be the best for sensitive skin Its very coarse and you have the be gentle when washing your face as it can definetly be rough but I find that it helps to manually exfoliate really well and I use it avout twice a week Definetly a keeper in my skincare routine , I wouldnt suggest this cleanser for sensitive skin The bamboo stem powder is pretty course for delicate facial skin The enzymes didnt do much either unfortunately Ill def continue to use it as a body scrub so its not a waste , Jaime beaucoup ce produit il marche super bien je le recommande  , Works great without damaging your skin and a little goes a long way My skin feels amazing , This makes my face pretty smooth but it is REALLY course Make sure not to scrub too hard I was worried it was going to leave scratches on my face after the first time I used it Scrub gently with this one , Ive been looking for a good facial exfoliater since Ol Henrickson discontinued theirs This one is nice and scrubby while using bamboo great for the environment It is also very reasonably priced The only improvement would be if they offered a version with fragrance  I know people with sensitive skin prefer fragrancefree but I like a pleasant scent when I wash , I swear by this stuff I was using the Ole H pore sauna scrub before I decided to try this and I have to say I used up my OH and am now exclusively using this as my physical scrub I love the fine texture of it and the way it makes my skin feel I scrub for a minute and then let it sit on my skin for 2 minutes like an express mask and I love the result every single time The price and what you get cant be beat Love these kind of finds , I really love this exfoliator  Ive used many I like this one because its not too abrasive but its exfoliating enough that your face feels smooth after you use it  I love the price point and a little goes a long way it lasts a long time  Thanks Sephora for another great product , Im so impressed with the exfoliation and cleansing of this scrub Its as good as the Dr Brandt Microdermabrasion at a fraction of the price I hope they never do away with it its in my weekly routine thanks Sephora , I have very dry flaky skin that is also incredibly sensitive Giving this product 4 stars because I think it would be awesome for most people but given how sensitive my skin is my face was red and unhappy all day after trying Wishing it had of been better for me but I think its a great alternative to expensive products for others , Great product especially for the price Mature skin approved , As I have been trying different products I am finding that all of the Sephora line items are of higher quality and cheaper price than just about anything else I love this cleanser And everyone I have used it on likes it too , Great for the price I guess Got a sample to use in the shower as a secondary scrubwash after my Kate Somerville Acne face wash I hated the Fresh Strawberry scrub  my OG First Aid Beauty scrub was discontinued so I was looking for a happy medium between the two Its effective but you really have to rinse to get the exfoliating beads off they get everywhereincluding in my hair I dont mind so much bc Im using it in the shower but if this was over the sink it would get messy Ended up buying a full size after the sample ran out  it is hard to get out of the tube since its so thick But for the price  effectiveness  such Ill deal with it , the exfoliating beads are too mild and it is difficult to even get it out of the bottle I expected better out of Sephora , I love this exfoliate  I have  had flaky skin on my face and this helps a lotIve never had a skincare routine since it would burn my skin no matter how many Products Ive tried Now this was gonna be the last try finding a skincare product and Ive now found it Its perfect , Exfoliating wise yes Bomb But I can rinse my face 3 times and still have tiny little exfoliating beads on my face a bit annoying but still very good product , Ok not joking here I have weirdo combo skin that cant decide if it wants to break out from oil like A middle ugh aged woman with acne get old and shrivel like a raisin or do both and break out into hormonal stress acne while aging from sun damage as a teen So exfoliators are a MUST in my beauty regimen Now at first I was totally in love with fresh strawberry sugar scrub And while until I bought this baby it was my favorite ever the Sephora collection version blows every other product out of the water The exfoliant is very tiny fine but gritty smoothing Sand textured particles I can only compare it to that perfect grit nail file that shapes smooths and buffs all in one Plus it still suds like a normal cleanser so it rinses easily 5 star product at an awesome price my new exfoliation product for life , This product was more effective than i thought I really like an exfoliating skin care product and the price point was good so i thought i would try it  It made my skin feel really good although not as glowy as others once i rinsed off I use it once a week as it is a little abrasive so a little goes a long way , I had such high hopes but I hated this The enzymes felt like harsh sugar salt across my face and got even more abrasive once I tried to rinse it off Honestly reminds me of the St Ives Apricot Scrub Wouldnt recommend way too harsh for the face , Love this product its gentle on the skin and smell nothing"
Brightening Eye Cream with Caffeine and Hyaluronic Acid,"Im on my second or third jar of this eye cream so obviously quite impressed with the product IMO it does a good job of reducing puffiness and minimizing my hereditary dark circles Works well with concealer and provides decent moisturizing For a heavier hydrating effect I use the firming eye cream in this line For the price point it cant be beat ununder concealer , This is one of my first eye creams and Ive repurchased a few times Very hydrating and great if you put in the fridge Havent noticed a huge difference but still pretty good , Would not recommend this at all This made the skin around my eyes extremely dry itchy and flakey Ive never had a problem with eye creams before and my skin isnt particularly sensitive , Super impressed by sephora brand as their products are usually a miss I suffer from dark circles no puffiness Ive used it for a month and noticed a brightening effect right away I only use it at night as it separates my concealer but it makes my eyes brighter all day , I used to protect for a few months now And all it did was dry out my eyes top and bottom , After using this for a full month now I can say Ive definitely seen positive results As a new mom Im sleepdeprived and get the you look tired comment a lot This has noticably brightened my undereye area and I look a lot fresher and awake now , I am in my midtwenties I just recently started thinking about eye creams since they are habits to start early taking care of the skin Ive tried a few creams including this one which I like Each one has different effects this one holds up well despite the cold Canadian weather I havent noticed yet if it really helps with eye brightening but it soothes and promises to protect my sensitive and fragile skin under my eyes I feel moisturized and I like the price its worth it if you dont necessarily want to go to the higher end , I have been using this product for 6 months I definitely see a difference with my dark circles Its moisturizing and wears well under makeup I love the price buying again 100 , I switched to this eye cream when Origins line was not available at the store and I have been buying it ever since It is as good as the more expensive alternative and the container is lighter hence easier to travel with I even reuse this little container for skincare products when travelling , I was looking for an affordable alternative for eye cream and this is the one This has pretty much all the ingredients my under eyes are looking for I just need a little extra moisture since I tend to get dry around my eyes  and it does the job It absorbs fast too And theres no fragrance so it doesnt irritate my eyes I think its great for both an affordable option and with simple ingredients I also feel like my fine lines have reduce a bit and it helps to depuff my eyes I notice on days I dont wear makeup people not saying I look tired as much as they use too Definitely recommend , These little Sephora brand eye creams are they only brand Im buying ever again So affordable and instant results I like to toggle between the brightening and firming Dark circles completely vanished , after using this am and pm on a clean face for less than a week I already can see results my eye bags are slowly lightening and feel great being moisturized definitely recommend , You pay for the basics you get the basics I wasnt expecting a miracle or luxury experience eye cream if you want saphoras 75 products are available Im satisfied to have eye cream that is natural hydrating and worked within my budget , Its a decent eye cream Not my fav not the worst but I do not like the packaging When youre in a rush in the morning its a little annoying because the cap doesnt screw on right one my first try , Light and absorbs well but doesnt do anything for brightening Good amount for the price but wont be repurchasing , Cant reallyyy tell if this is doing anything but its great value for the price  , Bought this for my fiance and I and neither one of us had success with it Wanted to love it because its a well priced eye cream but unfortunately this was a miss for us It completely dried out both of our eyes and make the skin around them flaky  so much so that I could not properly wear concealer when using this product unless I wanted to look like I had dandruff around my eyes It also reacted poorly with my FAB Ultra Repair Cream leaving me with redness around the eyes , I use it every 2 days and wowI notice a very big difference from being dark to getting lighter , I honestly feel like this was a waste of money Ill stick to a moisturizer , Tiny jar but seems to last Light non greasy Very moisturizing , Love the price and that its clean but cant say it works that well I like the consistency and refreshing feeling on my skin but I dont wake up looking refreshed somehow my eye looks more tired with this on Wanted to love this  , Very hydrating but cant say it brightens my under eye , I love this eye brighter It has clean ingredients and i have seen a different in my undereye dark circles I feel like i can walk out the house without any conceal , Not sure if its working or not but it feels refreshing to put every night , Great under eye cream  This cream keeps the skin around my eyes plump and hydrated  Decent price too  I love the charcoal bottle with adorable pink cap  so cute   Sephora reviews are terrible Every product has two good reviews followed by a horrible review or vice versa  I guess Im gonna have to just try any product out for myself if Im interested , Ma donn des rougeur et des gonflements Mes yeux pique et brule aprs 5 utilisations , I received a sample of this as a first time mom with a 5 month old baby who hadnt slept through the night since before baby was born Ive always had some dark circles but needles to say I was a good test subject at this time in my life I tested it out only putting it on one eye while continuing my current eye serum on the other I thought I notice a difference after about a week but was truly sold when I went to ask my husband for a sanity check Before I even finished explaining that I was testing something new on one eye and wanted to see if he could tell a difference  he told me the eye I had been testing this cream on looked better It didnt completely eliminate my dark circles but the improvement was more than Ive seen with a number of other eye creams , I absolutely love this cream I am 35 and a busy Mama of 2 girls  a hubby wserve sleep apena So needless to say I dont get good sleep This has been a game changer for me I have spent so much money on SO MANY creams  serums but nothing worked like this one didIt also helped wtoning  firming around the eyes I also purchased  love the firming eye cream I wish I wouldve took before  after photosdefinitely going to start and do so from here on out to post Dont hesitate if you are looking for a good cream , I bought this cream and its honestly very very hydrating and rich Only a little bit could go all the way It lasts long too I love it and Im always gonna use it , Read the reviews and was hoping for good results for my dark circles Been using for months and although it does hydrate my under eyes it hasnt done much else , This is an excellent eye cream  It keeps my undereye area moisturized all day  I can tell because my makeup doesnt dry out and give me undereye wrinkles  I cant tell if it brightens anything since I dont get dark circles under my eyes but I doubt this cream can change darkness that comes from allergies or genetics  Still its a great eye cream at a very reasonable price , Hydration is fine but it doesnt do anything for dark circles puffiness   Ive been using it for months  Would love to find an affordable product that works , I used to think the little white jar with the pink lid was so cute and it made me happy Now its an ugly gray jar with the pink lid I want to hide it behind my other products The inside is still the same though so thats what counts in the long run , Works great My concealer doesnt crease and my eyes look fresh , I love this eye cream  It feels so light yet hydrating  also helps with depuffing , I have been using this for about a week so I cant say it has made a big difference in the brightness but I wanted to write a review anyway just for how nice and creamy yet unimposing it is I use this in the morning and its an excellent moisturizing eye cream without leaving a heavy feeling or getting in the way of makeup I only took off one star because it expires quickly after opening and its such a big jar that I know I wont use it all before its expired It was also not sealed which makes me worry that itll expire even sooner , I use this product in the morning and at night its amazing Glowing under eyes helps with dark under eye and puffiness , Ive been using this eye cream for about 6 months Ive had two eye infections since I started using this Ive come to the conclusion that this cream is whats causing it since I changed everything about my makeup after my last infection , This product has become a staple in my routine I cant recommend it enough Ive definitely seen a difference after using this , Ive been using this for two months and I quite like it Its not too expensive my eye area feels moisturized I feel like I am noticing a difference in my dark circles Would buy again , Wanted to love it but useless Consistency is too thin did not make any difference and I tried for a long enough time I went throught 2 of these , It took some time but after about 2 months of using this eye cream people finally stopped telling me that I look tired I have never been using an eye cream before I tried this one The only thing I can see now is that it is a little heavy comparing to the eye cream I am using now Nevertheless it does the job and the price is really good , Received as a gift once and loved it Very hydrating and I have seen an improvement in my puffiness in the morning , great eye cream light and moisturizing easy to apply and it works , After using this product for the past five months I do not feel like it is very hydrating and it often makes my concealer separate under my eyes which I never had a problem with before , Did absolutely nothing for my dark lines and circles and I used it daily until I finished the whole product Will not be purchasing again , I am happy with the results I am getting after using this every day for about 2 weeks Im constantly on the lookout for products that reduce the puffiness under my eyes and I think I found it , It definitely brightens the under eye Im caramel skin toned NC42 and it really made a change I wouldnt suggest wearing it under makeup Its weird texture so its best worn alone probably at nigght night , This is the best eye cream I have ever tried It does wonders for my dark circles and makes me feel confident without makeup , Makes concealer cake and crease so bad I kept switching concealers thinking that was the problem it was not Once I switched eye creams the problem stopped , Been using this for about a week now and started to notice a difference straight away A little product goes a long way so this small pot is great value for money My under eyes look far less grey and puffy and feel so hydrated , When I saw this product had caffine in it I was all in Battling fatigue  overwork my blood is actually about 90 caffiene The surprise was what a good product this is too  Light not sticky or smelly and eyes not only looked brighter but felt brighter too  Of course if your eyes are very deep set there may be small irritation in outside corners of the eyes but quickly clears up if avoid those areas when applying  Will buy again , I am a black women with brown skin For 3 days now I have been using this eye cream My routine is applying in the morning and at bedtime I have terrible dark circles which are aging me I have notice a huge difference already within 3 days I also use The Ordinary Caffeine drops under my eye before applying this cream I believe together these products work great For  2 years I was using The Ordinary Caffeine drops by itself and it did not work , I was very disappointed with this  It didnt do anything for the puffiness under my eyes and I wont be buying it again  To finish it as fast as possible I have been putting it all over my face Its just a regular moisturizer , This is the most amazing product ever Got rid of a questionable dark spot near my eye and hasnt returned Shocked me and my dermatologist Amazing Thank you Im hooked , I like this product enough I used the Ordinary caffeine eye serum for a while and I think this one is better I find it more moisturizing under my eyes I dont think it wowed me but for the price Ill definitely buy it again , When I tell you that I have tried and used a lot of eye creams I really mean A LOT There was only one other eye cream that I repurchased over and over again Sephoras is making that list I appreciate the lightweight yet super hydrating feel it gives It feels like a gel but acts like a cream It also primes my eyes beautifully for under eye concealer or color corrector I have to get another one , Absolutely useless for dark circles save your money dont bother , Ive been consistently using this cream for a week and in the sort amount of time I actually noticed a significant reduction with the redness and puffiness under my eyes It was an insecurity it made me look older then I am so Definitely would recommend a try , It didnt bother my sensitive eyes and I generally liked it It is too much brightening for my medium olive skin tone though so it was a bust for me This was my first hylauronic acid and I felt like it thinned out my skin , Nothing special Noticed zero changes Wouldnt repurchase , I didnt see any improvement to the skin In fact I bought a second cream to use because this one felt like nothing I use this one to hydrate my lips and lips contour before bed now just so I dont feel like it was a complete waste of money Still doesnt feel like its doing anything , LOVE Not an over powering smell glides on smooth not oily or greasy feeling Makes my eyes feel moisturized and nourished 10 out of 10 would recommend as its budget friendly too , I rarely use eye cream as it always feels tight and dry I tend to use 8hour cream as it is so hydrating but this may make me a convert  I am not sure how bright they are but they are not itchy which is a HUGE BONUS in my books , Okay so I went into sephora one day looking for an eye cream I have realllly bad eczema and the most sensitive skin ever I asked one of the workers what would be the best for me and I just wanted something that would help the dry skin on my eyes I am only 20 and on a budget so she recommended this to me and honestly i didnt know if it would be good but it really isz It healed all the dry skin on my eyes and didnt cause any irritation or redness I cant go a day without it now I really recommend this , Ive been using this product for the past 2 weeks and Ive been loving the results my under eyes are more soft and hydrated , Didnt really notice any difference just felt nice to apply it , It is a nice moisturizer but it didnt improve my dark circles or iron out my wrinkles I am in my 40s and recently started to notice the age in my face Ugh But I am trying out some of the items at this store and have found better If someone gifted it to me I wouldnt refuse it but I wouldnt buy it again , Ive been using the Brightening Eye Cream for about a month I think it works fairly well and I enjoy using it most at night However it doesnt seem to absorb that well into this skin Even if Im using a small amount of product and let it sit for a while if I use it in the morning under makeup my concealer will crease and just sort of pill on top of the cream Might be best for those who dont use undereye makeup , Product dried out and separated in a weird way I didnt take it out of the house it wasnt exposed to heat but it seemed like it I wont buy again , Not sure it makes a difference on my faceeyes but I do find it moisturizing and easy to apply You also receive a lot for the price I do recommend , Ive tried a lot of creams over the yrs This is my new fav Glides on easily  absorbs quickly I see immediate results upon waking Puffy eyes I reduced and fine lines diminished reduced wwwawakingwakingredimmediadifference , This cream keeps the skin around my eyes from drying out but thats about it It doesnt do much brightening or antiaging , its hydrating for sure bit doesnt really brighten dark circles as it should tried for few months before giving up , I have been trying A LOT of eye creams  this one works and I see an immediate brightening effect to combat my dark circles and hollowness , This cream really does brighten the eyes I have not seen any changes in fine lines but have been noticing a difference in puffiness l This is my second purchase , I LOVE the lotion but the new grey packaging smells terrible and very strong of plastic Its concerning what plastic chemicals may be seeping into the cream , Eye creams are usually not worth it to me but wow this one really works Gets rid of fine lines and puffiness whenever I use it in the morning 1010 would recommend , Good eye moisturizer for the price but I havent noticed any change in the appearance of my dark circles I have been using this product for 3 months now , This product is ok I usually get the caffeine under eye cream from inkey and that one is better I noticed much more of an improvement on my dark circles I would recommend trying that one , So far I am starting to see less puffy eyes but the dark shade color on the bags of my eyes hasnt changed yet After about 4weeks of use , I enjoy most of the Sephora Collection so I thought I would give this a try I went through the entire thing and it has some decent moisturizing effects but I needed some real help with my dark circles not hereditary this cream didnt help with those at all I use retinA at night and this cream didnt bother my sensitive skin at all It would disappear into my skin and in the morning my eyes were the same as they ever were I guess I just need some serious caffeine or something Decent product especially for the price Im now using Clinique all about eyes rich cream and REM Beauty cooling eye these two together seem to work a lot better I guess Im just past the age of not using a color corrector  concealer unfortunately I would recommend this Sephora Eye Cream to anyone just starting to use eye creams and I know some people say eye creams are unnecessary but Ive religiously used them since I was in my 20s and that has definitely paid off since Im now in my mid 40s and dont really have any crows feet and very subtle under eye linesretinA really helps  Ive only just started that 4 months ago Dont forget to wear sunscreen Hope this review helps someone out , For the price youre getting a lot of product which is nice Unfortunately the cream didnt do me any good in fact it was making my eye area even more dry I would wake up the next day and notice my eyelids are super patchy dry skin which isnt normal to me at all Love the affordability but the product didnt work for me , The first photo was from 4 days ago I use this product in the morning before I do my makeup and before I go to sleep Ive seen immense results only within a couple days My eyes look less puffy more hydrated and less darker It doesnt move my makeup at all and makes my under eyes look less create I 100 recommend , Amazing eye cream I have been using this for a long time It is perfect for under makeup It never creases or moves my concealer , This product gives great hydration which I was looking for Just amazing for this price , This product is great and I actually notice a difference of my under eyes looking brighter and lighter Better than other more expensive eye creams I have tried from Sephora , I love this I find it very hydrating and the formula is been smooth and light so application is easy , I have very sensitive skin and get eczema around my eyes too This eye cream has kept my dark circles away and I will be repurchasing , Moisturizes well and helped fix my dry undereye from everyday concealer and makeup remover use However makeup Does NOT sit well over it Concealer peals no matter how shortlong the product sets and dries , Absolutely magic after the first few uses I can see it was working I have acne and it even brightens the entire face if applied as a moisturizer I will order again but hopefully I will not have too My eyes look brighter and I look even  more beautiful , This product peels every time I put it on I cannot apply makeup over it , I have been buying this eye cream for years It was thick and moisturized all day When I washed my face at 1000pm after putting this on at 600am I could feel it coming off because it stayed on so long They have changed the formula and packaging from the full white container and it is a HUGE difference The cream is now very thin It absorbs well fine but it doesnt feel like its moisturizing a fraction as much as the last creamWhat happened Sephora This used to be my favourite product I will now be looking for a new eye cream that actually moisturizes , Love this eye cream its the most effective Ive found so far Perfectly moisturizing not greasy and fine to wear under concealer After only using for a week Ive noticed it is already effective against under eye bags  puffiness I also have very sensitive skin and it has not caused breakout or irritation Hasnt done much yet for my dark under eye circles yet though , This is really great when used twice a day it made such a difference in the appearance of my undereyes I did get a weird tingling feeling sometimes but like maybe that is just it doing some magic This tub will last FOREVER because a little goes a long way , Am noticing a small difference Dark  puffy bags under eyes are starting to decrease Have only been using this product for 3 weeks Will absolutely purchase this eye cream again , Im used to luxury eye creams This one is amazing for being so price friendly It works well with eyelash extensions I use under my eyes Their other one I use on lids Good under makeup , Even after applying for an entire month  still couldnt see a single affect on my dark circles , For the price its ok for a nighttime eye cream I guess but I felt it didnt make much difference and didnt moisturizer the eye area much It does pill a lot so I dont even try to wear this under makeupconcealer anymore because the eye area will look so patchy and crumbly I definitely wouldnt repurchase this and definitely dont recommend , Affordable eye cream Hydrates eyes and works on dark circles I can see change in my undereye color Thank you sephora for such a wonderful product , This is a perfectly fine moisturizer especially for the price Havent seen any brightening benefits though , The cream is very light and oily I dont feel like it does much of anything especially compared to my old eye cream banana bright eye cream by Olehenriksen I also feel like it leaves wrinkle marks in my make up after I put it on top I dont think I will be purchasing this cream again definitely not worth the money , I love this eye cream The outer corner of my eyes are usually very red and dry While the redness did not disappear I can say that my outer eye area is now less dry and itchy Great quality for the price Worth a try , This is a really nice eye cream for the price It is rich but not greasy and a little goes a long way with a generous size to really test for results While it has not made a major impact on my circles I think it has improved the color darkness Ive been using it for less than one month though so I will continue using and hoping for results , GoodWould definitely recommend this product as this was firming hydrating and ultimately moisturizing my deal circles undreye bags , Made my eyes puffier than they were before I applied it Does not work Versed under eye cream is what I recommend Its the first eye cream that has worked for me , This is a nice eye cream for the price Its silky smooth and really soaks into the skin , Trs bon produit je lutilise chaque jour  Il stend trs bien  Je recommande ce produit , Did nothing for me I guess you get what you pay for since it was so cheap , 100 works and makes a difference I swear by the Sephora collection it provided luxury results for reasonable price , I wanted to love this because Im constantly fighting hereditary dark circles and this is way more affordable than most eye creams but it just pilled like crazy on my skin  , En lisant les commentaires laisss prcdemment par dautres acheteurs javais espoir que ce produit pourrait aider  faire partir mes poches sous les yeux Cependant jessaie cette crme matin et soir depuis 3 semaines et je nai malheureusement pas observ de diffrence avantaprs Jai encore les mmes poches sous les yeux que javais avant  Mais je dois quand mme admettre que jaime bien la texture et que cest agrable  appliquer pour se rafrachir le dessous des yeux , This is very effective eye cream for brightening the delicate area around the eyes I use it every morning after applying under eye concealer I noticed a difference almost immediately  The price is very reasonable for such a nice cream , Very light feeling Really like it and I can see a difference in my eye bags , This just sits on my face Hours later the area around my eye starts to feel gunky When I rub it this stuff pills up and falls off , Love it Immediate results and MUCH less expensive than other similar products So good that I use it under my chin and around the mouth area at night Dont stop making this please , This is a great way to fake it and make it when you didnt get a good nights sleep The puffiness goes away immediately I look alert and refreshed and when you look good you start to feel good , For someone with sensitive skin i appreciate how this cream is unscented It does help reduce my eye puffiness in the morning but i find it doesnt do an awful lot to help my dark circles However for the price it does its job perfectly fine I just wish it helped with dark circles more , excellent cream decrease puffiness and brighten the eye area  , I honestly havent noticed a difference with this  I guess it moisturizes fine soaks into the skin within a couple minutes but does not brighten these tired nurses eyes I think its probably a good eye cream if youre just looking for a bit of extra hydration but in my opinion its not good for anything else unfortunately there are other products that actually make a noticeable difference to dark circles and depuffing so Ill be sticking to those , I was really excited to use this product due the reviews but every time that I was using it the cream was pilling my eye area , Il sagit dune bonne crme pour les yeux  bas prix Ayant la peau sensible la plupart des crmes contour yeux me font des boutons Javais peur avec celleci mais elle ne ma fait aucun bouton Toutefois le point ngatif est que je trouve que la crme est riche et grasse pour le contour des yeux donc cest long avant quelle pntre dans la peau , I was actually surprised by this eye cream Im in my mid 20s and I wouldnt say that I have a lot of concerns toward bag or dark circles but I do see nice results and Ive been using it for the past month , This is the first eye cream Ive ever pruchased I bought it because well Im officially a quartercentury old and its the time to start focusing on these things Been using it for about 3 weeks now and dont see much of a change in brightness but then again I dont have super dark circles or any other issues Its got a nice cooling effect and feels like a little treat when I apply it with no major side effects A nice added selfcare step , Im not usually a fan of Sephora brands but this cream is fantastic Used on my eyes after not sleeping for 3 days and they opened up like magic I do find it a tad white but wow the transformation was impressive , I have very sensitive undereye skin with dark circles leaving it difficult for me to find an eye cream that doesnt irritate my skin Ive tried multiple high end vitamin C eye creams and to no avail I ordered this as a last stitch effort Ive been using this Sephora cream for three weeks consistently and I find I no longer need to reach for my concealer as much as I did before Its so gentle it doesnt seem right that it should have any grande effect  but WOW Absolutely love , I have been using this product daily for the past week and I already see a small difference Im sure that if I keep using it for a few more weeks my dark circles are gonna be almost gone I make sure to also apply on my eyelids and cover a great area around my eye I then massage it into my skin It always makes me feel so refreshed , I noticed a difference in my undereye circles not long after I started to use this About halfway through the container I even noticed a difference in the darknessblue in other areas surrounding my eyes I really love this product Its gentle around the entire eye area My eyes definitely look much better and brighter , It took some time to see results and Im really happy that I stayed with it Ive been using the grande lash serum for my lashes and I got the common side effect of redness around the skin of my eyes It got really bad so I decided to use this to see if itll help restore and brighten the delicate skin around my eyes and it worked Its very gentle and considering how damaged the skin barrier around my eyes was im thankful I didnt get a reaction from this cream It significantly reduced the redness and Im waiting for it to come back in stock so I can order my second one Give it a try youll should see results in a couple weeks coming from my experience , I really like this cream  It doesnt burn my eyes  I  would buy it again  , Great everyday eye cream for the price ingredients and size , This may be a good product but certainly not for really sensitive skin It immediately cause"
Clarifying Lotion,"I like to use this as a spot treatment under masks or as a finishing touch after my nightly skincare for stubborn acne Gentle enough that it does not overdry , I love this if I happen to get a random blemish pop up It dries out so quickly , It works wonderfully as a SPOT treatment This is not meant to rub on all over like a lotion or moisturizer I shake it up really good about once a week and then let it settle as the bottle indicates Then I take a q tip and dip it into the powder at the bottom and apply that to any pimples or blemishes I have as the last step in my nightly skin care routine It works beautifully If pimples arent gone in the first night I use again for a second night and that does the trick One of the BEST blemish removers I have ever used Idk what me or my teenage kids did without this in our cabinet , Efficace mais rsultat disponible au bout de 1 semaine , Im so glad I bought this It works wonders and helps with redness , My favourite spot treatment ever It literally erases pimples over night Like other reviews I did find it can come off on your pillow but it just rubs off a bit and it still works fine , I use this during the day when Im at home Otherwise it gets all over your pillow and wipes off I wont be returning but wish I got another option that doesnt flake offeven when I barely move , my pimples dries in 1 or 2 nights and It prevents me from scratching them , Unfortunately Im not sure how well this works as I had to stop using it because of how it dries Once on and dried its starts flaking off leaving a trail of the sulfur treatment everywhere especially on my clothes Ive used other drying lotions from different brands and didnt find that to happen I thought about just using it just a night perhaps but Im just most of it will just ended up on my pillow , Great for those pesky pimples that just pop up out of no where By morning the pimple is dried out , I really enjoy this product This product is to help clear or make breakouts smaller But this doesnt mean blackheads or cystic acne Just small pimples that you get from mask wearing or hormones I dap this on my forehead pimples before going to sleep and I notice a huge difference Id say the only downfall is the flakiness Its a great price though so I dont mind , I actually love this stuff because the salicylic acid content seems to be high enough to dry pimples and keep pimpleprone areas free of acne without overdrying I do wish they listed what the percentage of salicylic acid is  Anyway Ive been using this for quite awhile and the key to making it work is to NOT shake it up and to thoroughly and deeply dip your swab down into the powder really getting the swab fully covered thickly in the salicylic powder and then dab it on your zits and even lightly dab on acneprone areas This has helped me immensely to both get rid of pimples and to keep acneprone areas pimplefree You really need to get a lot of that white salicylic powder on your swab so that you can put a thickish layer of it on pimples otherwise it will be too diluted to work optimally , If we shake it what happen  Because I dont see the no shaking and I shake it Can I use it or no , This is a cheap alternative to Kate Somerville but I still prefer the Peace Out dots or the Proactive on the spot treatment to this This took several days to make any impact on a cystic acne spot on my facelike 4 days and the thing I liked least about it is after it dried it flakes off and gets the dust all over everything including clothes and even my phone screen I wont be purchasing this again , Didnt do much to my pimples and blemishes and I used it for several days It flaked on my pillow so I would suggest applying it way before going to bed Kind of disappointed but the price point is decent , Love this  I only rated it 4 stars because it does flake Although  it did work to dry out my blemishes I would repurchase , Was recommended to me by the sweetest employeeesthetician I wish I could say this worked but sadly it did not  it flakes off shortly applies weird and didnt clear my acne , Terrible  The sales associate told me that this Clarifying Lotion would help with any incoming blemishes She stated to put it over the blemish at night and by morning I should see a difference That was a LIE  No difference at all  Putting toothpaste on my blemishes was way more effective than this product  I returned it and got my money back , I been using this for a couple weeks now on occasional breakouts I dont see too much difference in blemish reduction it flakes a lot btw , Not the best choice for treating blemishes It is watery when I apply it with a qtip I didnt see much of a difference in my blemishes , I do not recommend this product It never worked for me I will definitely buy EradiKate by Kate Summerville over this version , Works great Dries any spots right up overnight Does get a bit on your pillow at night though , This is a great product of you want to reduce the size of your zit I will give it that BUT it does flake off easily After applying it the next morning it was all rubbed off and it transferred on my pillow So I works just wont repurchase it I would recommend mario badescu instead , This worked next day my pimples  cystic acne sz was smaller , Didnt find it helped my breakouts Thought it would be a good dupe for Kate Somervilles but it didnt work with my acne Decent ingredients tho , Whether its already on the surface or you feel zitpimple coming try this No tingling and horrible scent Been using this especially now that I wear masks for my whole shift Never shake and just use a qtip or cotton swab and do not double dip Use this as the last step in your skin care Only con is once the product is dry on the skin it starts to flake off  But Once it starts to do that I like to pat it with a little Josie Maran light oil or whatever moisturizer I used , Ive loved the Kate Somerville EradiKate treatment for years and was hoping this would be a dupe Unfortunately for me it didnt help with any of my spots whiteheads or deeper cystic ones They were either the same or deeper when Id clean it off Im sure for your average acne sufferer this will do fine I just dont respond as well to salicylic acid as well as I used to Its got great ingredients and like I said might work better for people with a less severe issue with acne than what I have , This stuff really does work it helps shrink your pimples significantly and helps reduce redness However the only thing to beware of this does rub off easily compare to other products Ive used similar to this When waking this stuff was all over my pillows Overall very good product works very well , instant resultsmy pimples were significantly reduced by the next morning"
Clarifying Peel Pads,"Got this for my son who has teen acne   Nothing seemed to work until I got him these   Big difference for his acne , Loved Really helped with break outs I have oily acne prone skin Cant wait for it to come back in stock , Didnt clarify my skin at all every time I used it small red bumps would appear on my face I stopped using it for a couple of days to see if it was the current cleanser but no it was these pads , Love These curbed basically cured actually mine and my brothers acne I was about to go back on accutane but then I started to use these and decided not to since they were so effective , Ive been using these for about 3 weeks now alternating with the glow peel pads and they work amazing Its really helping with my breakouts  Would definitely recommend , I love this product such an affordable and well made product after a few uses I can see the glow in my complexion I definitely recommend giving this a try , These are not bad definitely refreshing and made my face and neck feel clean Im giving 4 stars as I didnt feel like they were hugely effective but thats because I didnt use these regularly if I had I likely would have seen more benefits Also good bang for your buckNot sure how potent the ingredients are but theyre not irritating to my combination skin I wanted a cheap peel pad alternative to the expensive brands and these were not bad Theyre nicely coated with product but quite thin so you might need a couple to wipe your face , I bought this reading the reviews and Im not gonna lie I am kind of disappointed The pads are not soaked enough After working the product in one pad only did half of my face It seems really gentle because I did not feel any burning after applying Will have to use more to claim it helps with acnea My skin felt softer the morning after , I was looking for a salicylic acid spot treatment and this works great for me My acne was worse in the past grade 3 but has calmed down until recently I started breaking out again Using these pads once a day on days where I feel extra oily has helped my skin clear up I use it mostly on my tzone but occasionally on my cheeks if I feel I need it Great value and very effective I saw results within one week of use , I love how this peel pads are very general for sensitive skin I usually use it every morning before putting on any skin care products , I love these pads I use them once every night after cleansing and then put the peace out acne serum and my god my skin has gotten so much better It also helps with the blemish and weird bumps , A new must have for my routine The pads arent too harsh on my oily skin but quite effective at maintaining break outs and pore size Plus you cant go wrong with the price , Wow  Ces pads sont vraiment pas cher  la qualit ma agrablement surprise Sans irriter ou asscher ma peau ces pads ont beaucoup aid  rduire mon acne Je viens de commander mon deuxime pot Alors je recommande ce produit sans hsiter , Wow Everything about these pads makes it a forever staple in my skin care routine After struggling with dry skin and bumps on my forehead I decided to give these a try based on a recommendation from the Sephora employee Within 2 days of use my bumps were visibly reduced and my skin felt softer as most of the dry patches had gone away I also paired this with the Sephora brand moisturizer and Im blown away by my skin now Really recommend if youre struggling with dryness that will not go away with any exfoliating products as well as stubborn acne bumps that reappear on your skin For the price you will not be sorry you tried this , These are okay Definitely not a dupe for the Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel but they do the job of smoothing my skin My only complaint is that these pads are kind of dry Sometimes I have to use two pads to clean my whole face and neck I probably wouldnt purchase these again , I get horrible acne on my chin and jaw line I bought ridiculously expensive cleanser from a dermatologist and it didnt help Then my skin began flaking really bad all around my nose and mouth I ordered this as I was told by a different dermatologist years ago salicylic acid was what I needed to help with my acne And since The Ordinary stopped making their serum I had not found a suitable replacement I ordered this and the the Inkey lost salicylic acid cleanser Within 2 days there was a noticable difference My chin has cleared up quite a bit and all the acne under the skin on my jaw line is quickly getting better Really happy with the purchase Ive ordered other products from this line and have not cared for them Pleasantly surprised with this one , Ive tried both ZO pads Complexion Renewal  Oil Control  2 types of Salicylic acid products from Paulas Choice This BLOWS THOSE OUT OF THE WATER both in performance and in price ONE pad was able to clear 98 of my face  chest acne breaking out from new sunscreen  because I hadnt been using any salicylic acid products in a few days as I had ran out of my previous product The pads arent as drenched as ZO pads up to you if thats a pro or a con but I feel its superior as its not as textured meaning its not as abrasive to your skin Pad size are also larger so you can use this product on face and body Ive been converted will definitely be stocking up on these the next time theres a sale , I bought it 3 months ago It burned the skin of my face However I started using it on my neck and my back It cleared my acne hyperpigmentation and marks Its a good product to start with and the soaked pads are really practical for a quick morning routine , Ive tried different peel pads and this one is def decent Not as harsh or extra strength as some others but delivers and does a good job at removing dullness to skin and leaving a smooth more brighter you Can use more frequently too as its not as harsh Overall a great Sephora product , Quick and easy Use them for a quick wipe down before my serum and moisturizer in the morning , These are decent I recommend the glow peel pads instead I fell in love with the glow peel pads which is why I gave these a try If you have uneven skin complexion or just feel like your skin looks dull get the glow peel pads Also Sephora skin care deserves more hype , Wowowowow Ive tried ALL the things to get my hormonal acne and other random acne under control and this with The Ordinary Zinc  Niacinmide have been my miracle duo I like to use a cleanser use one of these pads nightly put on the Ordinary serum and finish off with a moisturizer I was out of town for a week and my face broke out while I didnt have these came back and it died down after using these pads again for a few days My new loooong sought after staple , I gave it a 4 star for now since its my 1st time using it I have a normal skin and first time i use it i feel a lil stingy on my skin i didnt rib the pad i glide it slowly and smoothly Im not sure if thats d salicylic acid i have other serums that has salicyclic acid in it but didnt feel any stingy at all so not sure It may work on ur skin or not Give it a couplemore tries and see if i still got the stingy feeling Afterwards my face feels hot not burningAlso pads are super moist i had this over a year now TIP be careful coz the pads tends to stick to each other make sure ur only grabbing one , I use this on clean skin before bed for acne body scars and I noticed a difference the very next day it evens out and slowly clears the discolorationsthis is life saver for me I was afraid the wet pads would dry over time since this is just a plastic packaging but it remains wet like when it was openedits clean which is always a plusI hugely recommend and travel friendly toono leakage , Love this product  I use it in place of a toner twice a day  It helps with pimples and I can really feel a difference on my skin when I dont use it , Love these pads They are great for when I am too lazy to wash my face lol , These pads were great and nice to have around Sometimes when I wake up in the morning my skin is extremely flaky no matter how much I moisturize it before bed and then I must take more time to get ready These pads would make my flaky skin disappear and would pick up any dead skin left behind These pads helped me so much when I had minimal time to get ready and would create a surface that was ready for moisturizer within a minute I hesitated to purchase these at first but for a peel pad they are inexpensive and they work I also do not use these everyday  I save them for when I really need them so they are worth it for me , I like these pads  The main thing that turns me off is the smell I prefer odorless products for the face Besides that I like the results so far Took a few days but I did see less acne on my forehead , So glad I found these I was breaking out after a change in environment and this brought everything up quickly and helped my skin heal Theyve also really helped the texture of my skin from previous acne scars and my moisturizer seems to be more effective when used after these pads Ill definitely keep it as a staple in my routine , Got this product for my boyfriend I couldnt get him to wash his face enough but using one of pads after he showers is so easy  All of his whiteheads on his chin are gone I would recommend this product for sure , Love this  I use this when Im feeling lazy about washing my face Very saturated and cools your face nice , These peel pads are so great I use them after Ive washed all makeup off and they pick up any residual makeup dirt and or bacteria that is left They leave my skin feeling so smooth soft and blemish free Thank you Sephora for making such an amazing affordable product , buying for a second time because these are amazing i have extremely problematic acne prone skin and my skin looks amazing after using these , this is a nice product which is great on my hubbys oily skin with large poresit has help reduce the look of acne scar texture its got a nice light clean scent which isnt overwhelming  I use them when my skin is oilier than usual Im combo to oily great for price point I received this to try and I will definitely repurchase , Ive just purchased this for the second time and Im loving it so far I do this every night before bed and I think its very refreshing after a long day too , I use these nightly and feel they are just as good or if not better than the more expensive name brands They truly clean and help with texture Very happy with them I do notice that sometimes they arent as wet as Id like them to be but thats the only negative , Love these pads They are gentle enough to use daily This is a GREAT solution to Mask Acne I use this on my face before and after I wear a mask out and it has stopped all those terrible pimples I was getting , These are better than expected After using them for a few days I noticed a difference in my skin I was also surprised that I could use them 2x a day as recommended without it drying out my skin , These have helped my blemishes and the texture of my skin so much Even after the first time using them I noticed a huge difference my skin was smooth and glowing instantly Took away the texture and dullness and my blemishes started to diminish right away Would definitely recommend , Love these I used these every night after cleansing and before my serumsmoisturizer and Ive noticed that my skin has had less acnebreakouts since adding it to my routine , I like that these are affordable and seem to be working on my sensitive skin They have a scent that I do not particularly enjoy but it fades quickly , Ive been using these for a few weeks and I can appreciate how gentle yet effective they are I find that they have been helping with some of the texture on my chin and cheeks , I think these would be great for people with really sensitive skin to acids I found I could use these twice and my skin was okay For me the Peter Thomas Roth max correction pads were more effective Both pads have similar primary ingredients so itll depend on what youre looking for The Sephora pads are a fraction of the cost as well , Good product I would recommend the serum over this to be less wasteful Revived this as a gift so I tried them out Serum is very similar and should give same results , They smell really good and are very gentle Leave my skin feeling smooth after each use Feels more like a toner than a exfoliating solution I personally would prefer something stronger but I still keep using these because It still leaves my skin feeling softGot this product as a gift , These clarify so well I have combination skin with not a lot of trouble with acne but Ive always had red patches around my nose and on my chin that I think are little acne clusters I was using the Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peels every day for 2 months and they did nothing for these spots Ive been using these Sephora pads for 2 weeks and the bumps and redness are GONE These didnt irritate my skin and dont really have any strong scent For the price and what they do I highly recommend , Sephora sent these to me for review and I was excited to try them because I love products like this Theyre pleasant to use and make a nice toner But I didnt find them to be at all clarifying My face is really used to acid though If youve never tried an acidpeel product I can see these being a good place to start I do wish instead of just listening fragrance in the ingredient list theyd be more specific , Like most I have been STRUGGLING with mascne and this has been a godsend I use these in the morning and night time after I cleanse and I have already noticed such an improvement , I love these I always use exfoliating pads and these are a great affordable option that works amazingly Helps clear my acne and brighten my skin my skin feels soooo clean after I use these I have very dry sensitive skin and I can use these three or four times a week with no irritation , I love this peel pads I got them as a sample to try out Since I started using the pads my skin looks so smooth and clear of blemishes I definitely recommend I will be repurchasing once I am out , These clarifying peel pads are great They stung my skin at first but it went away quickly They werent super drying on my skin either , Ive been struggling with dry patchy and peeling skin lately after using these pads for a couple of weeks  both morning and night my skin feels smoother and stubborn pores on my nose are improving , This contains Salicylic Acid so it calmed my skin and reduced my breakouts  Maybe because it also contains citrus fruit extracts it stings a little when I apply it on but the feeling disappears after a few seconds  My skin is fine afterwards too , My skin has been looking pretty much its absolute worst due to lack of care during quarantine and personal face masks Nothing seemed to work on my once clear skin I had breakouts and pigmentation that wouldnt budge It turns out that using harsh ingredients to combat maskne is counterproductive since maskne is a form of inflammation and irritation that causes havoc by making your skin sensitive under the mask My skin typically doesnt tolerate harsh acne products since they use very strong ingredients and are often combined with alcohol which only makes the situation worse These peel pads are gentle but effective since they use natural salicylic and glycolic acids to decongest the skin without stripping the skin of its natural oils They are so easy to use dont sting your skin and are loaded with product Ive been using one pad at night before moisturizer in the fight against my maskne and it decongests my pores without stripping my skin or causing irritation The zits have flattened out and the glycolic acid creates a glow too As opposed to wiping the pad over my whole face I position it so that Im using one quarter of the pad for one quarter of my face and use both sides This helps prevent acne migration and allows the pads to do their job more effectively The cherry on top is that they are clean products feature sustainable packaging and are made in France I made a list of changes to my personal care routine to combat my maskne which you can read hereMaskne Advice Pt 1 and Maskne Advice Pt 2 , LOVE these pads I use them morning and night I love that they are part of sephoras clean line I was sent these to try out and I have been using for about a month I had no negative effects from it They feel so good on your face theyre also super gentile The salicylic acid helps with keeping ur skin clean and free of bacteria I use them on my face neck and chest I definitely have seen a difference in the clarity of my skin since using them and will be repurchasing , Amazing Received as samples to review and am absolutely obsessed Thanks for the introduction to a great clean skin routine , I received this free for a review  I am very careful what skincare products I use because there are so many on the market making false claims and that have ingredients that promise to be effective but are not  Case in point when I consider a chemical exfoliant as in these peel pads I want to know the pH level of the acid because if its not the correct pH level it wont effectively exfoliate no matter how much active ingredients are used  I do not know the pH nor did I have test strips to see for myself so I am uncertain if I would recommend these  I have used these for about a week and in my early to mid 40s have skin in fairly good condition with minimal fine lines and occasional acne but cannot tell if this made a difference in the week I have used it  If this is I believe within a pH of 34 it should work well and is a decent price  I cant tell  The pads are well hydratedthey are adequately saturated with product not too dry like some other skincare premoistened pads are , I really really love these My skin feels so clean after using these I will definitely repurchase , Such a wonderful product After working all day in a hot kitchen these wipes are very helpful , Such a great affordable option   This stuff works wonders on acne  I received this free for testing purposes and I highly recommend  Great for helping reduce the look of pores as well , These are great at helping clear up my acne i wouldnt rub all over your face though just concentrate on acne spots and itll dry them up , I have been using these pads for 3 weeks now one a week and i decided to wait 3 weeks before writing my review So these clarifying peel pads feel gentle on the skin i didnt get any bad reaction These pads contain salyclic acid which is the key ingrediant for treating acne  scars and blemishes I dont really suffer from acne but i do have some blemishes And i gotta say everytime i use these pads the next day i feel like my skin is brighter more clear and healthier Theres nothing bad to say about these pads They are not super expensive like other high end brands they work the same way as them By the way its very important to wear sunscreen after exfoliating in order to not get a sensitive reaction , These are really affordable and work just as good as some of my high end ones salicylic acid is one of the best types that you can use on your face because its more gentle yet effective These have decent decent ingredients and actually work but dont hurt your pocketbook , They feel like they wouldnt work at first because they are so fragranced but my some of my redness disappeared this morning when i put it on last night I just dont enjoy the fragrance but I have high hopes for this , This stuff is terrible and leaves a gross sticky film on your face , A great Clean and budget friendly alternative to many of the other Peel Pads out there  The pad itself is thick and juicy to be effective when sweeping over skin unlike many others that are too thin and dry out too fast  I like the the Salicylic  Glycolic Acid combo that targets congestion and dullness while being super gentle on my skin  Good for first time exfoliators or people who have been afraid to exfoliate  Would definitely recommend adding this into anyones skincare routine for a little added glow and you cant beat the price , I use these peel pads in the morning before my skincare and minimal makeup routine I love the effective yet still pretty gentle exfoliation no burning I get when I sweep the peel pad over my face I like how saturated the peel pads are even though they are quite thin 1 peel pad is all you need for the whole face I use the textured side This also doesnt separate or break my complexion through out the day Its important to use SPF if using this product , I love love LOVE these peel pads They make my skin so soft Ive only been using them for a week and I already see the difference in the size of my pores I havent had a breakout since I started using them and theyre so quick and easy to use that I never leave them out of my skincare routine even if Im tired A little tip for those with sensitive skin the first time I used these pads my face was red I used the pad and then put my serum right away and then my face got red Now I use the pad and then put the serum like 10 minutes later and I have no irritation at all  , They smell divine are gentle on the skin and make my skin care routine just a few seconds longer than the zero minutes I want to spend on it , I love these especially for nights when I just do a cleanser wash and skip the clarisonic these make me feel like Ive gotten all the goop off plus exfoliated Its like a fast way to get a couple of steps done when you dont want to spend time on a full routine , I have more of a combo skin type but definitely see an increase in oiliness and breakouts once the summer ramps up I received these for free to try for my honest review I was a little worried about them irritating my skin I use them around 3 times a week since i got them and they havent irritated my skin at all I noticed they healed some acne i had and my pores do look smaller I think this is a great deal You get a lot of pads 60 and the price is good I definitely would buy them , Ive been using one pad each night for the last 2 weeks instead of my usual liquid acid and let me tell you I LOVE themI really love that Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid as a skin care ingredient The pads are very moist with product so I was able to treat my face and neck and chest with 1 pad Its a dense and compact application easy to use and so refreshing So all you need to do is swipeI received this product as a free sample thank you for this amazing product , Love these peel pads They pack a onetwo punch with exfoliating and purifying Natural ingredients is a plus and a must These pads are nicely textured and thick Leaves your skin feeling clean I featured these peel pads in my YouTube video beyondshadow2020 along with a bunch of other products from the S Clean Collection , I got a full size of these free from sephora and I didnt expect to use them then I ran out of cotton pads for my usual clinique salicylic acid toner and started using these Honestly they do the same job but saving me a little bit of money time and supplies Convenient to throw these in my purse to use at work to prevent mask acne I would get more of these , I have not tried this product as my skin is dry wrinkled and just plain old I have passed this on to my daughterinlaw who says it works for her , Wow Where were these when I was in high school These are so much more gentle than the acne pads I used to rub and damage my skin with The formula is still potent enough to work on my acne without being completely corrosive These need to be in your skincare collection , I do like using a Salicylic acid in the morning but I have to say although these were ok I do prefer my paulas choice 2 Salicylic acid instead  Its more of an oil consistency and I feel like it doesnt dry out my face quite as harshly as this one does  but when I can out and these were sent to me for free I did use these and they were fine  FUN FACT if you dont want to get maskne mask acne add two of these to the inside of your mask  its cooling and antibacterial , If first aid beauty radiance pads are your holy grail like they are for me the give the Sephora brand a try They are fantastic Not drying Make your skin feel clean and glowing  Sephora YOURE DOING GREAT SWEETIE these are a star , Loving the new CLEAN AFFORDABLE skincare much appreciated , These are small but holds up a lot of product I love the texture of the pads they are soft and dont irritate my skin I dont find them drying but I also use them once a day at night They did wonders for my skin I was beginning to experience some maskne and after one week my chin was cleared up 60 pads should last me around two months so I think the price is good for me although if used twice a day you have anough for a month which might be a bit expensive if you have to repurchase every month , Ive only been using for a week and WOW Maskne is 99 goneI also paired the clarifying spot treatment at nightDidnt dry my skin out and cleared my skin up , Let me start by saying its my new favorite I gave it a full week of use before writing a review I have combination acne prone sensitive skin that has some age related pigmentation too I used these peel pads with my nightly skin care routine but skipped the toner as I was afraid it might be too harsh on my skin usually I use Glow 2 OH toner by Olehenriksen at night So I simply wiped my face and neck with this peel pad and directly applied my moisturizer In the morning I continued with my usual skincare routine These peel pads are tiny super thin but have more than enough amount of product to coverwipe your whole face and neck These are very very gentle and did not irritate my skin Honestly my skin felt much smoother with a few days of using it For exfoliation Ive used Juice beauty stem Cellular exfoliating Peel Spray so far but after trying out this Ill continue with these peel pads  as this is easier to use more gentle and gives better result at the fraction of the cost Even my teenage daughters skin felt much smoother and clearer after using it for just 3 nights Love the fact that its a clean product too I received this product in exchange of my honest reviews and Im so glad to have found my new favorite when it comes to exfoliation , I usually dont need a clarifying product often as I save them for when I break out usually one or two once a month and sometimes when Im under a lot of stress or lack of sleep but these have been the ultimate skinsaver due to having to wear a mask everyday I use 23 days a week to keep my skin under control and Ive found that theyve been incredibly helpful Even though I only use them a couple times a week they are gentle enough for everyday use as they target the areas that they need to while not drying out my skin overall They cleared up a couple whiteheads and clogged pores around my nose within a day or two and have kept my nose blackheads at bay I also love that theyre so easy to use and that a single pad can help keep my skin looking beautiful and clear while being super affordable as well I will definitely keep these pads around at all times since I am loving the results from them , These pads have a great combo of ingredients salicylic acid and  glycolic acid  They left my skin smooth glowing and clear  The fragrance is too strong for me , I really like these peel pads Its a tiny bit tingly and it leaves my skin feeling clean soft and fresh My face feels super fresh afterwards and I feel like its making my skin softer and smoother The price is great too , I love these peel pads Love the fact that they contain salicylic acid , I will definitely add these Clarifying Peel Pads to my skincare routine  Each pad is nicely saturated and they dont feel rough on your skin  They have a pleasant scent and feel cool on your skin  My skin immediately felt soft and smooth  It doesnt feel like it leaves any kind of residue on your skin  My pores appear smaller and they work very well on the occasional blemish  due to wearing a mask and the humidity of summer  I thought they worked great and will to use them , These actually care a lot of moisture despite being small Theres a smell but it isnt strong and actually smells good My face didnt sting or get irritated from this after trying it for 3 days When I used this I didnt use my glycolic acid toner or any serums that had AHA or BHA because this was strong enough This helped lighten my dark spots and cleared my overall skin , I have only been using these peel pads for about 5 days but I do see a difference in my face I have never been one to get a lot of acne at once but due to mask wearing I find I have been getting more These pads definitely help reduce the redness in my skin I do it before bed and in the morning my face looks a lot better I will continue to use these , These pads are effective but a bit too strong for my very sensitive skin Ive been using Sephoras Clear Skin Days Brightening Peel Pads for the past six months and love them Will stick with them as they are not as strong , Sephora sent me these in a gratis package in exchange for my review Very solid 5 star product I have tried peel pads from other brands that certainly did not outperform these and were more expensive The pads are thin so you must take care not to accidentally remove more than one pad at a time These are very saturated with product and nicely glide over skin Very refreshing bringing a brightness to the complexion and toning down redness I had a pimple try to form on my chin but these wiped it right out Will definitely be purchasing these in the future , I received this product as a free sample for my honest review I like these very much and saw a difference on my skin after using them after only one day I woke up to more glowy even skin The ingredients are pretty nice I would use them first and then follow by an essencehydrating toner serum and moisturizer I have acne prone skin so I always end up my routine with benzoyl peroxide on my problem areas For reference my go to routine is BHA"
Clarifying Peel Pads Purify + Exfoliate,Ive been using these pads for a few days now in the AM  PM and I definitely notice a difference in the smoothness of my skin right afterwards The oil control is an added bonus I have combo skin because my tzone has been slower to produce oils even without using my usual niacinamide serum With respect to acneblemishes I dont have a lot to begin with so I cant comment as to whether these are helping preventcontrol breakouts Overall these are great to use before your makeupskincare routine and I will probably be making these a regular purchase given the price point
Clarifying Serum,"I really hate that they stopped selling the serum this has helped my skin so much from redness irritation and breakouts The pads are not the same as serum , I totally loved this stuff it would try out acne fast I wish they would bring it back , I love this product This really help me out with my acne prone oil skin I hope they bring back this product , wonder why this product is discontinued because i love the formula and application helped with acne moisture smoothing my skin overall , Helps control my acne Great product I recommended it to my best friend , This is one product is the best It was taken of the Market please bring it back , I felt like this make me break out more than it did clear my acne , I have slightly sensitive skin and wasnt too concerned when my face broke out upon trying this product Unfortunately this was not the case and now have marks all over my face Not worth switching to , This stuff cleared my skin PLEASE PUT BACK IN STOCK  , I have hormonal acne and I cannot go without this product now that Ive found it If you have issues with occasional breakouts and blackheads this is a great product It is super watery but that hasnt been an issue at all for me In fact the texture helps prep my skin for makeup perfectly Highly recommend , I bought this hoping to replace the Ordinarys salicylic acid The scent of this product is unbearable  it smells like a sicklysweet nail polish remover The scent is so strong and unpleasant that I was hesitant to put this on my face The consistency is very thin and watery so it drips all over and makes a mess It didnt irritate my skin but I didnt see any benefits either All in all pretty disappointing , Been trying it for a few weeks and havent noticed a difference still got some breakouts Giving it two stars because its Green and not expensive Ill use it until its finished but wont repurchase , Ive been hit hard with mascne over the past few months and this has been my saviour My texture is going back to normal and the redness has gone down significantly The texture of the product is easy to work in  enjoy it much more than similar products from The Ordinary , i simply love it it helped my skin alot within few weeks my skin was much clear , Not bad but didnt really work much for me Used it for a week every morning and night on targeted areas and nothing really changed Other salicylic serums have worked more quickly for me but they have been discontinued The product is very watery and smells almost like a diluted nail polish remover to me Not my favourite , I was so disappointed when the Ordinary discontinued their salicylic acid serum it was 13 the cost and worked really well Although more costly the Sephora brand is still worth every penny I have had hormonal monthly breakouts on my neck and chest for my entire adult life and there isnt anything else that has worked to clear up my skin so fast If I apply in the morning my skin clears up dame day I dont actually use this on my face i have a more expensive antiaging serum with salicylic acid for my face I do apply this to my teenaged sons face and it works well to help keep his face in better shape He gets a lot of breaks outs  It  doesnt keep his face totally break out free but it does help them clear up quicker I do notice it dries out my skin so its something to be aware of i need to wash and moisture my hands after use or my finger tips get very dried out , I love salicylic acid it keeps my pores looking clear and just gives me perfect looking skin I tried this serum  it cleared up blackheads around my nose that I had never noticed I switched to paulas choice BHA for about a month thinking it was a step up because of the name brand and my skin just wasnt as clear  I didnt wake up to the same glow that I get with this product I have dry skin  as long as I fill my routine with hydrating products I can use this nightly with no problems with over exfoliation or dryness Its honestly gentle enough to use twice a day It IS pricier per ounce than most other BHA serums Ive used but its worth it Dont be hesitant because its Sephora brand it is 100 effective Ive tried BHA from Clinique PTR PC and DermaE and nothing is as effective as this product without being too drying , Used this serum for a couple months My main concern is blackheads and this serum did help about 30 It is not listed what percentage of salicylic acid is in this but Im guessing it is on the lower side This is a great affordable option for someone who wants to try salicylic acid to see how it would do on their skinwith a product like this that is not too intense , Life Saver Just better than me pay forty dollars for marios , I have incredibly sensitive skin the smallest thing can cause my skin to go into a civil war I had a friend recommend this product to me and it is the best thing that I have ever personally applied to my skin Within a week the redness and texture of my skin simmered down to a casual dispute Within a couple weeks my skin was almost flawless Of course scarring from cystic acne is a thing so that is still visible but I am loving me , Really the best serum it smells great and absorbs quickly Im on my second bottle Within 3 days of using it my skin was clearer and softer , I bought this product when I couldnt find ANY salicylic acid products anywhere And it did not do as good as the other salicylic acid products Ive used I guess it works but really not to its full potential , Love this product so much It helps to moisturize but also clear my skin It does not feel sticky as many others do it applies very smoothly Love the dropper makes it so easy to get just the right amount Needless to say this product has made its way right into my everyday routine , This is really working for me It is watery so be careful I have tried many moisturizers and serums claiming to help with breakouts This is the only one that has really made a difference I hope they continue to carry this , Love this product Ive been looking for a salicylic acid serum since The Ordinary stopped selling theirs I really like this and its really helped to keep my skin clear of acne Ive bought it twice so far Im so happy with it , I wanted to like this so much since its pretty much the cheapest serum youll find but this stuff was no good I found it very drying and I got breakouts when I started using it I dont feel like it did my skin any good It also kind of smells like nail polish , I purchased this serum based on everyones reviews but I shouldve looked more at the ingredients I purchased for my horrible acne  used a for a few months  got moderate results but nothing major I noticed my active acne was smaller  a less red but didnt actually help with the breakouts I was having I looked at the ingredients  couldnt verify how much salicylic acid is actually in this serum I guess its ok if you arent using too many actives , Has helped minimize the painful big pimples from maskne and my skin feels so much softer Definitely will be purchasing again , LOVE THIS Ive been dealing with really bad maskne and this helped reduce my breakouts in just a week I definitely recommend this , Ive used this product day and night under my salicylic acid moisturizer and ive definitely noticed a difference My skin has less texture and less breakouts I still have acne here and there but its likely attributed to stress  hormones or diet This isnt a cure all  but it does its job , This is the REAL DEAL I got this out of desperation because The Ordinary has spent MONTHS reformulating theirs and I just couldnt wait anymore The price point is better than most and the formula is good for sensitive skin In terms of clearing out breakouts its amazing Whether its stress hormonal or maskne this is the product for you Im using it along with the Caudalie Vinopure Purifying toner The perfect combination It doesnt cause any redness either And reduces or eliminates breakouts overnight or during the day Also it absorbs quickly and well Even whenif The Ordinary brings back theirs Ill still get this one And thats something I never thought Id say This will be a new staplemust have in my routine , I absolutely love this serum  It works so much better than more expensive serums Cleared up my skin My skin is so smooth as well Will make sure I always have this in stock , Im a loyal user of the Sephora Ultra Glow Vitamin C serum so wasnt sure on trying a new serum And this serum did not disappoint Im so happy I took that chance This serum gets absorbed quickly and isnt as sticky as the Glow serum And I saw pimples disappear before my eyes It smoothed out my face so fast with just one use I still cant beleive how great this serum is compared to even the 100 ones Ive ever tried This is definitely my new serum of choice , My favorite serum ever I like it and its my third time I purchase it , This worked for me I have bad acne around my chin and regular hormonal outbreaks This serum didnt clear it up completely but helped with redness Repurchased it a few times , Its milder than many formulas for acne but it works well with other options it left my skin a little greasiershinier than I would prefer The ce serum works wonders , I really enjoy this product I have uneven textured skin and very visible pores around my nose I use this product when I am getting ready for bed and I had just washed my face This serum has aided me in minimizing my pores and creating a more even looking skin tone It does not make my skin feel oily or more dry after using it I love it , vraiment bon srum  doux et brillant jadore trop  , Recently added this product to my skin care regimen and it is AMAZING Sephora please dont ever stop selling this , I got this serum with 100 points I have been using this just before makeup It feels light on the skin is absorbed quickly keeps the skin moisturized throughout the day and hence prolonging the makeup Not giving it five stars because it didnt really do what it claims uneven textures poresetc  For the price it is a great product , This is a new staple in my skincare routine Excellent to get rid of my ormonal acne Quality at such a small price , Dont get me wrong I love this stuff but they changed the packaging and reduced the qty from 17oz to 10oz and raised the price from 1200 to 2000 This is upsetting , I have the other vitamin c Sephora serum too but after seeing this new version come out I just had to get it Unlike the other serum where it does help brighten my skin but left it slightly oily I find this serum as a nice switch as it does help with my pores and doesnt make my face as oily I feel like this would be the better option for hot summer days whereas the other serum will be more suitable for winter conditions In terms of consistency I find it a bit tacky but after applying my other nightly gel moisturizers and emulsions I can hardly notice the difference Overall great serum for a night time use , Ive used this for a month or so I still get a fair amount of pimples I havent noticed a difference but hopefully if I use it for a longer time it will help , ive been using this for about 2 weeks i havent seen outstanding results but it has stopped big breakouts and cleared up some old scars , Really good at clearing skin without drying it out  there is a very very light scent but its not cloying , Honestly this stuff is bomb If u steam your face beforehand apply serum and use a pore extractor afterwards you can get a crazy amount of gunk out of your face My skin looks amazing in the am when apply this serum the night before too Drop the money Its worth it , Finally something that actually helps my acne I have severely sensitive skin to products and Ive been struggling with break outs for two years as an adult in my early 20s but never had acne before this Ive been trying so many different products and this one actually really does work for me My skin has cleared up significantly since Ive added this product to my routine morning and night and I am so thankful for it Hoping it works for anyone else that decides to try it out , This product works better than my most expensive serums Ive seen a huge difference in the texture of my skin All of the tiny bumps on my forehead and cheeks have disappeared Ive also had way fewer breakouts since I started using it Its gentle enough to use 2x a day but still highly effective The results and the price point will make this a mainstay in my facial care routine , I am usually not prone to large breakouts but have small problem areas on my nose and chin It has reduced the occasional zits and I have seen a definite improvement in my skin It is a lot of serum for the price which I really appreciated The ONLY thing is the dropper is a little wonky But that would not drop my rating as it works ok once you get used to it , i was a little hesitant to buy this product at first because i have extremely sensitive skin so i have to be extra careful w what i put on my face but this serum did not break me out in any way  did not leave any rashes my cheeks and forehead used to have so much texture  i saw a huge difference even after 1 application i will definitely be buying this product again , Acne sufferers this is for you As a 30 something woman who still experiences acne I wanted to try my hand at some new products to see what will nip this acne stuff in the bud I have combo skin and I largely suffer from acne on my forehead area due to that particular area being very oily but Ive begun experiencing breakouts in areas Ive never experienced before due to poor cellular turnover I finally got this and tried it and its amazing I had five active pimples comedones on my forehead and two on my left cheek I tried this before bed and discovered theyve all vanished Im very amazed and happy This will now be a staple in my skincare regimen One star docked because its very drying I suggest using a hydrating toner before and a solid moisturizer after to preserve your moisture barrier , Great at preventing acne and really made my face real clear and smooth , I originally assumed this would be too strong for my face to use on a daily basis because of one of its main ingredients I have ultra sensitive and oily skin on my face I read the review and decided to try it anyway and Im glad I did It says you can use morning and night but I use it every night after washing my face I have no complaints If your hesitant give it a try , Loving this serum so far I used to use the Ordinary Salicylic Acid but I think its been since discontinued It has quite a runny consistency in comparison but I dont mind it Doesnt dry down super sticky either which I also like , My daughter and I love this product  It is working wonders for our skin , Absolutely amazing I love this product and will repurchase I have extraordinarily sensitive skin and my skin loves this Its light and I use it under the Sephora C  E Serum daily and Ive noticed improved texture Great ingredients and price point , I was using The Ordinary salicylic acid serum but I cant seem to find it anywhere now and needed a replacement product I tried Paulas Choice serums but the price tag was too high and shipping to Canada was always a hassle Enter Sephoras Clarifying Serum The texture of the product is watery which I like and not too sticky It absorbs well into my skin so that I can proceed to the next step in my skincare routine faster I tend to have oily blemishprone skin that is sensitive to many products but this didnt cause me to break out at all It worked just as well as more expensive products and The Ordinary The recyclable packaging is a bonus I wish it was as cheap as The Ordinary but Im still giving it 5 stars because its the most inexpensive yet effective product that I know of , I am having a flare on my breakouts It was pretty bad However after the first use it have shown dramatically reduction on redness After two days it is already showing improvement Thanks This is a great product I hope this comes in vacuum bottle design , Full stars of it had no fragrance the ingredients lost is amazing please remake the product with no fragrance it will actually work for those with sensitive skin and work better for regular skin The product will sell more and and start a new trend we need to stop adding fragrance to face treatments  , This product is a must If you use it properly and regularly you can tell a huge difference in skin It helps with blemishes  but also uneven skin tone and scars  My skin is doing great using this product , although this product claims to have natrual ingredients and properties the truth is youre probably paying extra  for the eco friendly packaging SIDE NOTE nothing wrong w environmentally safe packaging BUT I have a better CHEAPER and more EFFECTIVE alternative to this serum i HIGHLY recommend the The Ordinary Salicylic acid which is concentrated w pure salicylic acid  helps fight against breakouts My second recommendation is the The Ordinary Niacinamide Serum which is concentrated with pure niacinamide that breaks down clogged pores such as blackheads there is always a cheaper alternative to skincare and I highly recommend the brand The Ordinary ps Sephora has their products online , This is an amazing product for somebody who cannot normally use salicylic acid Because its actually a natural alternative to salicylic acid So if youre reading it and youre scared because it says salicylic acid dont be scared because it actually comes from a tree So you get the great benefits of salicylic acid without any of the harsh side effects or reactions The texture of the serum is very lightweight almost like a watery texture so it goes in really nice and doesnt feel sticky at all I would 10 out of 10 recommend this"
Clarifying Toner with Niacinamide and Zinc,"Perfect for those with normal skin not dry not oily but needs some toning after a cleanse Gentle enough for everyday use  gives a glow that comes from truly clean skin On my 4th bottle , I use this toner every other day  and it does help to tone my pores and help with skin tone   Light and easy to apply   I let it dry for a few minutes before applying other moisturizer sun screen makeup , Please never get rid of this Best toner for acne , It is your every day toner Nothing special  I do use it more often than usual just because its does the job , I needed an affordable toner that work and Id say I got it For me it helped smooth out my skin and make it look healthier , Even though I liked the feeling smells bad Wanted to use little bit more but didnt like the snelly , absolutely do not discontinue this sephora ill be so mad it does what it says for amazing value definitely a toner that works i bought in bulk so if that tells you how much i dont want them to discontinue it , This is a wonderful toner My skin is usually combo but lately its been oily all over and I was getting little clogged pores I wanted something to clarify a little more but without being stripping This did exactly that My skin has been clear and extra glowy I recommend applying it with your hands and not a cotton pad For some reason when I used a cotton pad it made me a little red and my skin seemed more dry I havent had that reaction at all when just using my hands , Just as Advertised I will be ordering more after I run out Thanks Sephora , Been using this for a couple days now and Im absolutely loving it I definitely recommend it  , i have sensitive dry skin and i have perioral dermatitis and this has helped so much with fading spots and preventing new breakouts a few reviews said it dried them out so i pair it with a thick moisturizer and havent had any issues at all def recommend , I was not expecting to love this product so much The Sephora brand products are always a hit or miss for me  They are either a must have or a never purchase again This product is an example of the former for me I bought this in the hopes that I could minimize the appearance of my pores and I was not disappointed Throughout my high school years I had an obsession with squeezing out all the gunk sebum in my pores and was left with enlarged pores and very red skin  some scarring Typically you need to wait a minimum of four weeks to see results with any skin care routine but I saw results after a week of using this It made my pores less noticeable and I noticed less cakeyness with my usual foundation Another benefit was that my skin felt cleaner to me It was the extra little step I needed after cleansing Overall I definitely recommend this product if you are looked to minimize pores reduce redness due to skin swellingirritation and an overall brightened look My only regret is not taking before and after photos of my face ConsThere really arent any but I like to include any drawbacks to legitimize my reviews You get a lot of bang for your buck with this product The bottle is a decent size for its price of 16 and cheaper than many of the other brands you find a Sephora though in my opinion it works better than most But because I apply using cotton pads you need to use quite a bit of product to soak the pad and have enough to press down and hold on each section of the face This bottle lasted me about 2 months so its a little bit of an investment as a student with no income But all in all totally worth it and the price is actually cheap for the benefits you get so dont let this con hold you back from trying it , I really like this product its helped the size of my pores and my blackheads and does not irritate me which happens quite a bit For the pricepoint its an amazing option , super great product i noticed immediate results and it is so gentle perfect for everyday use especially for the price i am very very impressed , The ingredients list was really great on this product however I found it to be more drying than just skipping toner and using a moisturizer I think this product would work best on someone with an oily skin type Personally I have a dry skin type and this product led to dryer feeling skin for me , Have been using this for about a week and so far its pretty good Skin feels nice after and not dry or sticky Was hoping for a little more oil control though , This toner does what exactly it says If youre new to niacinamide This may sting for the first few days but your skin adjusts nicely to it I saw visibly reduced pore size in less than 2 weeks , I use this toner at night after I clean my face  It leaves no residue nor does it feel sticky  It feels refreshing and has no smell which I love  It has helped with my acne scaring and face looks much cleaner and bright  , Awesome niacinamide toner  I love combining this on a cotton pad with Thayers alcoholfree toner and it makes my pores almost nonexistent  Ive been using niacinamide regularly for a while now and its been great for my skin but I wanted to add it to my morning routine and this has worked out perfectly  Its gentle with 5 niacinamide and the relatively simple list of ingredients doesnt conflict with anything I already have going  The texture is lightweight and watery  It sinks in quickly and really reduces the appearance of my pores  Highly recommended"
Clean 1 Minute Face Masks,"Let me just preface this by saying that I love the individually packaged version of these They are my goto after flights and they leave my skin so plump and hydrated Since I was doing more traveling than usual this summer I decided to buy the bigger pack to be more eco friendly but these are such a disappointment I have to strategically cut them to make them lay flat around my eyes and nose Its really frustrating because you would expect them to be identical just with less packaging Two stars because the serum on them really is amazing , I assumed it would be a great buy but it was horribly dry After 3 tries I looked up ways to add some life back to them and even then there was no hope It was a great try by Sephora but this one was a flop Ill still give it two stars because doctoring it with other hydration things are funbut the product itself is dry and didnt hydrate at all In short sis can not stand on her own , Just terrible and so upsetting It barely hold on my face having huge spaces No effect at all The mask is dry itself , OMG I wanted to love this I really did but it left my face so red and irritated I kept thinking is was because I left it on for to long 5 minutes instead of 1 but no its just the masks I love all the Sephora brand stuff and have never had a problem with them I bought all 4 kind of Minute masks that had I am soooooo disappointed , Very upset that theyre calling these clean and inferring that anything else isnt The old sephora sheet masksfoot masks were so much better for your skin than these theyre refreshing but do nothing anymore , Very unhappy with this product Was hoping it to be a cheaper alternative to a face mask but did not last long and left my skin burning and red Would not recommend to a friend , First and foremost I love the smell of this face maskAt first I was a bit scared trying it out and I must say that I love how hydrated and soft it left my skin For those who have sensitive skin this will not irritate your face because I myself have sensitive skin"
Clean Charcoal Nose Strip,"Doesnt work it didnt stick to my nose and its not worth 3 for nothing , You literally get one strip for 3 DOLLARS So I would so if you are really looking for something that gets rid of you black heads use an exfoliater with the nose strips at Walmart , It doesnt stick and wont work I applied it as instructed but it did nothing Its simply wasting your money on this product Please dont buy , Expected to get my teenage son nose clean from black heads and wasnt success the strip wasnt holding tight and the result was better from different brand not sure I would buy it again , Did not stick at all and did not get any blackheads out Definitely do not recommend , Love it It really works I would use more often if my bank account allowed me to buy that many , im gonna be honest i thought this would work because sephora collection is so great now but it legit did nothing just stuck to my nose and it kept coming up on one side , I dont know what I was thinking buying this I thought it would be a fun one off Its not This strip is full of fragrance It irritated my skin and even with pulling it iff gently all it does is rip off the top of your blackheads and sebacious filaments Go for a BHAAHA instead that will actually clear your blackheads , It wasnt too bad unfortunately it didnt take all my blackheads out so definitely not worth the price especially since there are far better ones out there for cheeper , I was excited to try this because I use nose strips approximately once a week Not only did it barely remove any blackheads from my pores but it also ripped my skin off causing my nose to bleed , The damp skin application process was honestly such a bastle because it wouldnt stick to crevices of the face and the edges would just stick out This was good for dead skin removal not blackheads , I bought 3 packages and the first one I tried out didnt really remove any of my blackheads A little disappointed I did follow the instructions too Hopefully the others will be better , it didnt work and its way too fragranced i was lucky not to have an adverse reaction because my skin is not sensitive , when i used this product it was an absolute miracle some of my pores stayed but mostly all of them are gone thanks to this , Great product  Worked very well i recommend this as it got rid of my pores efficiently , Im not sure why the other reviewers didnt give this five stars I find the Sephora brand more effective than what Ive used from the drug store Make sure you do a glycolic or AHA wash before No pore will be left uncleaned , It literally did nothing might as well have tried to put tape on my nose , Worked great Wish they had a set with more than just 1 , Didnt really remove any blackheadsnot worth using Smelled good though , Doesnt really do much unfortunately just feels like sticky paper on your nose  lol , Face was burning red and sensitive for the next few days If u use it make sure to apply ONLY on the oily areas for a couple of minutes Do NOT leave it on for too long , literally did nothing except take out some oil this would probably only work for people who have pores that unclog easily , Serious perfume I had this on for 30 seconds before i took it off The perfume is so incredibly strong it caused an asthma attack  horrible migraine I tried washing it off for ten minutes my stomach was sick from the migraine and smell I was in pain all day sinus and migraine  Also the asthma attack scared me I never had a product have so much perfume why put that much or any for a nose strip it beyond me My hands still smell after 24 hours Worst 400 and time I ever spent , This did nothing for me I left it on more that 15 minutes and when I took it off I saw zero blackheads It only left black residue on my nose I wish I could give zero stars but here you 1 star I do NOT recommend to waste money on this cheap thing , Works great love it  part of my everyday routine and I love it so much  if u have really deep pores like my brother I suggest worked so week for him I decided to purchase , just use it right it everyone is saying its bad but they are not using it right , Strip was dry and didnt work even after attempting to re wet it Very disappointed , This worked really well I dont need to use this type of product often but I definitely noticed great results after use , Loved this Worked really well for me the fragrance was a bit  fragrancy but other than that I was super happy with this , I really dont understand the bad reviews It worked so well for me I cant believe how amazing it is , This is THE BEST blackhead remover that I have ever used I dont have too many but this strip pulled out stuff that I couldnt even see I will be buying more Highly recommended , This thing hardly got the dead skin off my nose let alone any blackheads Hard pass , Really good compared to other nose strips after I used in my nose felt instantly smoother I dont normally by Little products like this but it worked really well for my clogged pores , They smell nice they work well and they havent caused me any break outs Usually my skin gets mad at me for using things like this but when I added these ones to my biweekly routine I saw improvement and had no problems , I dont understand all the negative reviews this thing is so easy to use and it washes off fine with a cloth leaves my nose so clean  , I followed all the instructions and the strip did not even stick to my nose properly I did not see or feel any difference on the sides of my nose , Worked amazing and wasnt painful to remove or left any irritation Used on my boyfriend and he was shocked at the results , It did barely anything and I followed the directions It left a residue on my nose and it hurt pulling it off Bad product , I bought it so that I could ship my bday rewards This product does absolutely nothing Doesnt stick onto the face Followed all instructions closely and ended up with nada Shouldve bought cotton swabs instead , I hoped it would have worked better than it did I never found a visible difference on my nose but it always looked like things were coming off on the actual strip so im not sure if it worked or not Also sometimes sticky residue would be left on my nose from the strip and it is a bit of a bug to get off , Utterly useless if not damaging Sticky Black goop stayed on my nose and made my pores darker , Useless I followed the instructions exactly placed it on a wet nose and nothing It removes nothing zero difference , They work 100 its too bad people cant just use products right before leaving nasty reviews Youre gonna get a good thing discontinued You HAVE TO LEAVE IT ON A WET NOSE FOR ABOUT 20 MIN Pull it like a wax strip and voila My nose is completely soft and no more nasty bumps and those horrible little hair things Use them right I promise you they work 4 , It works well but after removing it there was a bit of residue that had to be scrubbed off , This worked so well When I say this strip had little white dots all over it I mean it It got everything out from my pores on my nose and it didnt feel like my skin was peeling off when I removed it Totally recommend , I didnt find it any different from any other nose strip to be honest I dont have a major problem with my pores maybe thats why It did feel softer though , It was dry when I got it and didnt even stick if I could rate this is zero I would , worst nose strip ive ever used removed no blackheads although i had steamed my face prior and the next day i had more blackheads complete waste of time , It works well if you leave it on for the recommended amount of time or a bit more It actually worked for me , Surprised at the bad reviews  Not sure if they followed instructions fully but the sample I received worked great  Will totally buy on my next order , my mother used my account and got it for me for Christmas thanks for the points mom I didnt feel like it did anything not bad but not good , Would give ZERO stars if possible  absolutely no difference before and after use Contacted Sephora because I tried it single use I would not get a refund I understand that there is nothing to return with a singleuse but what a disappointment in supporting the integrity and quality in your brand especially when this is the first product of Sephora that Ive ever tried Waste of 4tax , Everytime I make a purchase on here I always add this into it Its one of my favorites I would recommend this but I do not understand why they put it in a huge box for this little small item I once only bought this item and it was in a huge box , Love the nose strip However received only one in a full box Please be conscientious when you sendsent items Please be earth friendly Besides you should sell the strips in a packet of 3 or more  , I had used this recently When touch its a little stick Applied it for 10 mins and then peeled it off Removed few of the blackheads not all though Can say not a great product but not bad either , It felt really sturdy on and felt promising unfortunately when you rip it off theres not much of a pull which is good if you have sensitive skin and dont want it to necessarily snag your skin but because it doesnt have a pull it doesnt take much out Yes it kinda worked in the end however there wasnt much on the strip when I looked if anything a bunch of raised little white spots were on my nose after So although it definitely worked by raising them out I had to manually try to squeeze the rest out and wash my face but it felt like they just got stuck raised underneath since they werent exactly all pulled out Im not mad though because I only got it to score free shipping but Ill probably look for a different cheapie next time , I would wish to give this 0 star Totally wastage of time and money , I ordered one of these my last order and couldnt wait to try it It took a lot of dirt and I was impressed as I just washed my face and didnt expect for it to pull black heads off my nose I already added to my cart for my next order  , It partially did the job I expected Not a bad product but I was hoping for more blackhead removed from my nose , did absolutely nothing and felt like some felt on a piece of tape , didnt do anything it just felt like i put tape on my face and ripped it off , I found this product okay I didnt find that it helped clear any blackheads but maybe it would have worked if they had been larger I did find that my skin was cleaner and felt much smoother though Overall worth the price but Im not sure if Id repurchase , Pretty good Better than most nose strips I think Overall decent product , unlike other reviews mine did stick on you just have to use enough water but it didnt get everything it especially didnt get the crease of my nose , This unfortunately did not work for me The strip did not stick to my nose properly and did not really remove any black heads , it unclogged my pores but it didnt do anything for my blackheads which is the reason i got it in the first place it felt nice and it didnt make my face break out but it didnt work for me at all luckily it was only 3 dollars so it wasnt like a waste of money , it took off all my blackheads i recommend using this product 1 a week , did not get anything out of my nose blackheads and other dirt , This product worked as expected but for being a Clean Charcoal product the amount of fragrance on this strip is overwhelming I could not wait to take it off and wash my hands and face It doesnt smell bad but its so strong it feels toxic , Does not stick first of all After 10mins I remove it and It did nothing , Totally ineffective Followed all directions and it pulled out about 3 pores of gunkdont waste your money Go with the tried and true brands that have been doing this for years , Absolute trash Does not stick at all just falls off and doesnt do anything , worked rlly good pulled out a lot of blackheads on my bf nose , I would definitely not recommend this it doesnt do anything I followed all the instructions as well please dont waste your money , It did not stick fell off and kept lifting up when replaced Did not adhere to skin at all I was hoping to use them if they worked , I like how thick and sturdy the strip is and was easy to put on and pull off However after it was all done and over with I saw lots of yucky stuff in the strip but it wasnt all of it I sat there with a tool and got out at least as much on my own after the strip It may be because I had a lot built up and may work better for someone with smaller pores For me it worked same as the pack of 10 strips for 7 at Walmart , I bought this product for my sister who loves it so much , Love these They pull out everything They get in my pores and it pulled all my face fuzz , This is a fairly good Nose Strip It didnt entirely clear out my pores but it wasnt very painful to remove I would say this is an average product , Definitely not worth 4 for 1 nose strip you can get the same thing at the dollar store for a pack of 10 , A wonderful product It was excellent for what I needed it for , Dont buy it waste of money     Didnt stick  to the nose or it doesnt have a pealing stick  I demand  a refund to everyone  one that didnt like it I rather go to miss a for the 1 mask , This product dont work and is a waste of money literally did nothing only hurt to peel off , I added this on to my order thinking it was at least a small box of strips nope Then I thought if its just one maybe it really works Another nope No difference after use and it didnt pull anything from my pores , I love it and it really works I just wish there was more than one strip in the pack , I really like it felt like it left my nose feeling clean and could see some dirt that was removed , Nose feels smoother but no gunkies came off on strip , Does not clean pores and there is no noticeable difference after use , This is my first product review I am taking time to write this review as I saw immediate result after using the strip Apply the strip as per the instructions on the package and you will see great results Great product for a great price , Works good Nose was clear after using it Wait for full 10 minutes before taking it off , Couldnt get it to stick it didnt do anything at all Save your 3 , Super disappointed Nothing special at all Biore strips are way better , Not impressed it does an okay job but doesnt remove it all , Very glad I didnt listen to the reviews on this one I followed the directions washed my face and left my nose wet removed the plastic film from the strip and stuck it on Waited 10 minutes and removed it and it worked great I took off 1 star because there is only one strip in the pack I guess for 3 you cant complain but I wish they sold a value size at a better price , Very satisfying after only first use I could see black heads on the nose strip after it was removed It did not hurt my skin and very pleased when I looked in the mirror and noticed almost all of my black heads were gone , Not worth the money The original Biore nose strips work so much better and theyre way more affordable , Really disappointed with this product Did not stick didnt do anything at all Had higher hopes based on the price Would not recommend , Didnt seem to work as well as I expected  had purchased it for my sis and my husband and it was so so I could still see the blackheads  , Honestly not sure what the hype is It didnt do anything for me and I know I have clogged nose pores so wont be purchasing again , Pour le prix  1 patch seulement cest pas srieux , If i can give this zero stars i would  This doesnt stick  its literally a waste of money It was so hard and uncomfortable  i saw literally no results what so ever  Wish i can get a refund idc if its only 3 , Works great I would say even better than the biore strips Only downside is that it is a bit pricey for just once strips but I still give this product 5 stars anyway , this is so easy to use and works great noticeable difference also only takes a few minutes to use I have sensitive skin and this didnt irritate my skin at all , Reread theres only 1 nose strip haha and sephora packaged it separately so I got a second large box for one tiny nose strip Maybe sell these as packs of several just weird Will rerate after trying the product , most useless thing ever dosent work dosent stick customer service dont wanna do anything dont wast ur  , When I bought this I expected an actual nose strip that actually sticked and everything but it really doesnt kinda like those bad stickers that just wont stick It obviously didnt do anything either Total waste of money , It was good but not best as per price its costly now i prefer to get from drugstore that was best  good price , For some reason it doesnt work for me I buy two of them try it two times still doesnt remove any blackheads of minenot even small blackhead , Dont listen to the bad reviews it works for me and all the nose strips I used before making me itching during the wait time but this one I didnt feel anything for the 10 minutes waiting time the down side only one strip comes in the package should be at least 2 as recommended twice a week , Follow the instructions and this product is amazing It really worksJust wish that Sephora would package them on a bundle not sell singularly , These worked great for me and I could notice the difference  I could see the blackheads that were pulled out on the strip and my pores clean , Helps cleaning nose pores and it is easy to useThis patch  is really working  i recommend it , My fav nose strip its just magic I have never changed my brand for nose strips Since I started using it , Just make sur you apply it on damp skin or it wont works Looking at my used strip was so disgusting and yet so satisfying at the same time My nose felt super soft and clean after using it love it , Ive a nonsurgical rhino done on the bridge of my nose which prevents me from getting my pores there extracted This nose strip helps unclog my pores in that area without agitation to the filler In that area makes my nose feel super clean , It got most of my small blackheads but I have a few big ones and it did nothing I dont recommend it for anyone with larger blackheads It adheres better if you wet your finger and rub the water into it , did not work it did not stay in my nose and i followed the directions do not recommend , Worst product at Sephora It is not adhesive does nothing , the worst mask ever it does not stick and does not help either , I got this in the Holy Sheet mask collection and was skeptical to use However I ended up trying it and was relatively pleased I dont have particularly bad blackheads on my nose but do have some noticeable whiteheads I left it on for the recommended time and when I took it off you could see that it had indeed done something , it barley got anything out and barley sticks i dont think it worth it i was so excited but it was short lived once i saw it did nothing i dont recommend this product , The product does not work at all my nose skin looks same as before Does not have any power adhesive properties so not even dead skin is sticking to it its like a weak sticker , Terrible it ripped while putting it on didnt really stick   Wouldnt use again , honestly this sucked didnt really work i think youre better off buying another brand because ive used nose strips before and they were wayyy better or even the  peel off mask , I love the idea is smaller pores especially on my nose but up until now nothing has done the trick I am a big mud mask fan but nothing truly extracts the stubborn black heads This DOES I pulled that sucker off and it looked like a porcupine I love this product so much I bought 5 more The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because I truly wish it came in a box The picture I posted is my second time doing it after a week the initial application was INSANE , Sadly this did not work for me and my husband We still had plenty of blackheads in our nose and didnt see any improvement , I used it today and followed the instructions carefully and then absolutely LOVED the results Im definitely buying more , I received this as part of the Holy Sheet Sephora box with different masks Did not stick to my nose even though I followed instructions Ended up just throwing it out So glad I didnt purchase it individually Would not recommend , Ive had some pretty rough nose strip experiences but these were recommended by many of my coworkers so I decided to try them out and Im glad I did They definitely are more gentle than some nose strips but they still get the job done My only complaint is that you only get one in each package which is a little pricey but I cant complain too much as they do work better than any other nose strips Ive tried , Just ok nothing special It just has one mask At drug stores I get same quality for greater value  its just nice to try it , I followed all the instructions as given and the nose strip did not extract like the product had  promised Dont buy , My favourite after I have a shower I use it once a week Highly recommended , It help to remove the white heads and black heads , Doesnt work I tried it twice it doesnt work at all , Works really well The first time I used it its worked really well but that because I left it on for almost an hour cause its really comfortable I used this tool that would scrape some of the extra stuff off Most of them either faded awaygone or didnt get all of it out I really recommend this if you have really bad blackheads like me I wouldnt use another for at least for a month I used it again after three weeks and same amount of time but didnt really work because they didnt really need it again Hope this helps , These worked really well at removing black heads and clearing pores the only thing I would change is they could be a little wider to get the cheek area around the nose as well , I wanted to love this but so disappointing Did nothing at all I used a Biore strip the next day and that was so much more effective , it didnt really do much to where I noticed a difference other strips work better , I liked the smell and the fact that these strips didnt get stiff and hard when they dried like the Biore brand of strips I just wish it came with more strips for the price that its at , have used this strip only once but love it really cleared pores and skin is really smooth will definitely use again , Tried many and never found one I liked until I tried this one Did the job  smelt good , Very expensive for one application This product is fine but not great , Did nothing to my nose still have all the black heads , Dont worry about negative comments it works well just follow the steps For best result use after shower damp ur most n stick it for 15min or completely dry  , Works really well Removes a lot of stuff out of the pores It does dry really fast though and it did leave behind a sticky residue on parts , Barely stuck didnt not remove the blackhead like I hoped , Great product  Works great  Would definitely recommend , Left adhesive residue and fibers behind that I had to rinse off with hot water I may not have dampened my skin enough I bought a second so may update after I use second strip with my skin more damp to see if that was the issue no immediate difference but did smell nice , These strips remove blackheads and are more gentle than other strips that I have used  The other strips I have used get too stiff and hard when they dry and they feel like they are ripping at my skin when I remove them but these strips are easy to remove These strips have a nice scent and do not leave any residue when removed  I will be purchasing some more , So Ive had a long history of trying to clear the pores on and flanking my nose Drugstore nose strips cleansers masks some highend even nothing ever completely cleared those pores Well one day I decided to include this with my order because why not Its only 3 more I went by the directions on the package and yes it hurt a little to peel it off and not much happened on my nose itself particularly the bridge I wonder if it properly adhered However I was truly impressed with what this took out of my skin on the sides of my nose I could see the circles of dirt on the strip and the difference was clear on my face I would be willing to try this again to see if it could better adhere to the bridge of my nose  but this is the only strip that has ever worked for me to any degree , This was a breeze to use worked great and didnt irritate my skin It was a cinch to apply and remove Purchased in a set with other Sephora masks and wouldnt hesitate to purchase on its own Love that its a Clean product and made with 100 natural ingredients that are good your skin and the Earth PS All the negative reviews did not use the product properly Youre supposed to apply it on damp skin which is clearly written in the directions , Unfortunately this did nothing It didnt stick well and when I peeled it off there was hardly anything on the strip Better off going with a salicylic acid treatment , Just tried my first strip today Took out all my blackheads on my nose , Its a nice purchase to clear black heads but doesnt cure the open pores , This does help extract blackheads Id recommended using after a hot shower or warm compress to make sure the pores are open and you can get the most out of one strip The smell is very strong though And there are cheaper options available that work the same if not better than this strip and those do not leave black residue around the edges , It helps me to clean up my blackhead I love it Ill get more in the future , It is fun to use and seems to make my pores a bit smaller , I wasted 3 a piece on these My boyfriend and I like doing nose strips together and honestly we where so disappointed Skip these and get the Bior ones instead Those are way better and cheaper , Le produit est un peu cher 4 pour une bande mais il fonctionne  merveille Jai t agrablement surprise Il faut sattendre  ce que a tire lorsquon enlve la bande , Trs bon produit pour moi Lorsque les tapes sont biens suivis ca fonctionne super bien , this did absolutely nothing I had trouble keeping on my nose because it wouldnt stick After 10 mins this product did not remove any blackheads , It got almost all my blackheads but it left black stuff around my nose and I did not like the texture , This does not work Its a waste of 3 It barely even stuck to my nose and didnt pull anything out , SoI got it cuz the price is good and I thought it could be useful But I just ended up wasting the money since it did absolutely nothing I followed the instructions and even tried applying it again after it didnt work the first time still nothing , I purchased this because they took away my usual boscia nose strips which I loved The Sephora brand has a VERY strong perfume smell before during and after it has been taken off The results though were great Wouldve given it a 5th star if the smell wasnt so strong , These are so underrated these cleared my nose and got rid of blackheads dead skin dn got rid of excess oil after a singleuse , WET YOUR NOSE Lol I see comments from people saying they dont work or stick In the directions above it states to have a wet nose before application I love these handy little strips Worked great , Loved this product it worked great Perfect for my blackheads just keep in mind its only one patch , Absolutely love This product is great Before using I either steam or use a hot cloth to open up my pores place on then dampened the strip slightly Worth the 4 bucks , worked nice i would definitely recommend for people with a lot of blackheads on the nose , Im so impressed with this product  It worked very well and was easier for me to remove than Biore  I just added more to my cart , This is a terrific product But DO NOT shift the strip at all after it first makes contact with your skin All the users who are complaining about the adhesive not working did this You have to get placement right , Worked well Removed some blackheads Comparable to the Biore charcoal nose strips , Silky smooth results I usually have a mini allergic reaction to nose strips due to being adhesive sensitive but this was excellent I got some big blackheads out and my nose was soo soft and smooth , Its works amazing Left my nose feeling smooth and got rid of some blackheads , Love this works amazing and had a great result 100 on my must buy listDefinitely recommend , Waste of money this product does not work  its doesnt even stick  , Dont buy Terrible Save your money and time , This was not work 3 plus shipping Disappointing , Works well on my skin I would definitely buy more of these it would be great if we had got this a pack of 4 , I truly wish I understood the bad reviews on this product I got this for my husband to try out hes used Biore in the past and he loved it so much hes already asked me to buy more No issues with application stayed on well and really cleared up his nose Didnt leave him stripped on dry afterwards just nicely balanced cleared up pores that was even visible to me , Doesnt adhere to the skin even when you follow the directions to a T  Not worth the price , The fact that this actually did bring out quite a lot of blackheads surprised me Tip make sure you open up your pores before using this and use a soft mist , Awesome They work great All of the other reviews were from people who were having a bad day  , While wearing it for the recommended time it started to come off on its own When it was time to take it off it was like I did absolutely nothing to the nose the adhesive is not good at all thankfully this was a sample it is a c complete waste of money , Your nose has to be damp when you put it on but even then its not too effective"
Clean Cleansing & Gentle Exfoliating Wipes,"This is good if you are on a trip or something and need wipes for before cleansing but i would not use this but itself , Sephora changed the formula and now they are horrible They leave a sticky residue on my face and arent exfoliating at all I loved the original formula that came 25 to a pack They were very exfoliating and really worked on my dry flaky skin This new formula is trash and I cant stand them SEPHORA BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULA , This made my skin burn and is not safe for sensitive skin It just felt like a waste wiping it on my face for no reason and throwing it out It smelled good though , Pleasant smell Doesnt irritate my face However it leaves a film on my face  makes my skin feel sticky Will not repurchase , i dont really have sensitive skin but these burned my skin absolutely horrible , They dont do a fantastic job but I dont think any face wipes do Smells good at least , There was a time you could choose either orIve visited multiple locations and check the app constantly but all they have are the clean ones They seem to be thicker but are very dry and just dont work the same I miss the old ones , Feels moist on hand but once you start using it it becomes dry so quickly It just tugs at the skin and doesnt even remove makeup effectively because of how dry it is Youre better off spending your money elsewhere , After using this product for well over several months it seems to be my go to product to have in all of my bags from work bag to travel bagsluggage to my purses I love the settle fragrance of coconut the coolness of the wipes and how it leaves my face feeling refreshed I would definitely consider this to be a staple in my daily regimens , I bought the Watermelon  Aloe full size ones a few months ago I like the clothes they are thick But they are also nearly dry Not enough to clean off makeup Sephora please fix this , I love how  these exfoliating wipes make my skin feel The only ones that dont make me breakout  , I am done buying Sephora wipes  They are awful the little watermelon packet was all dried out  now a regular size feels about the same  Ill stick with drug store wipes from a reliable brand , I really like these You can use it after the gym or if you want to freshen up I usually use unscented but it smells really fresh , These are great to have and I love how it cleans your face when using it , I use these wipes for cleansing my face  hands  also excellent as a replacement for toilet paper , Nothing special but for the price sure why not I would recommend the aveno brand for sensitive skin , cute packaging and nice smell dries out a bit fast but still very enjoyable , They smelled and felt nice  much better than a baby wipe haha I just feel they are slightly pricey , I purchased the Charcoal PurifyingExfoliating Mini Wipes I can honestly say that there is not much product on the wipes to truly clean your face I have been using these when i wake up in the morning for a quick removal of sleepeye bugersout of my eyes They are not really good for anything else , I love face wipes but this one was not moist enough for me Theyre a lot like the Yes to carrotsblueberries etc wipes which I also find too dry to be effective cleansing wipes , I used to use the old version Whatever this is now is terrible I just spoke with a chat rep on the app and they confirmed these horrible wipes are the only kind now Smells bad feels bad not a good change , Awful now They completely changed formulas They used to be 99 natural origin with no alcohol at all I loved them and would actually recommend them to clients as a safer alternative as a wipe if they truly needed them Im very anti face wipes because of all the alcohol that is usually always in them because it is so bad and damaging for your skin In fact I would buy some just to take on my vacations especially Hawaii It was perfect as an on the go quick face wipe after a day at the beach if going straight to dinner Now they have not only damaging benzyl alcohol but cetearyl alcohol It used to only have 12 ingredients now has 17 ingredients All junk Horrible Do not waste your money or sacrifice your skin See pic top one is original formula Bottom is new one , these wipes are not best if you want to throughly clean off all of your makeup , I have been using this for years and it has been totally been changed A new texture no exfoliating side and leaves skin uncleaned I will never purchase this again , These are terrible plus the smell is way to strong , Baaaaaaad It stings and feels harsh on the skin I wont buy it again , Had to use three of these wipes to take off my makeup All I was wearing was concealer and foundation too They are super small wipes Only buy them to receive free samples from Sephora Dont recommend , These wipes used to be amazing Now they are awful They changed the texture of the wipe and now they are dry and terrible Dont waste your money Disappointing , These wipes used to be my favorite soft and smelled incredible whatever changes were made and these are AWFUL now Rough and cheap and smell absolutely stinkyunpleasant These were a daily staple wont be purchasing again , I absolutely LOVE these face cleaning wipes They are the best I have ever used Ive tried MANY cleansing wipes and most leave my skin flakey dull or too oily these are perfect the closest feeling to actually washing my face I love these for mornings I am in a rush or on nights Im too tired to wash my face great smell the textured side is amazing for a deep clean I feel it remove my grease and dirt and make up this is an everyday staple in my routine , I love the Rose ones They were my life The smelled so good and my sensitive skin loved them , I did not like these as much as the coconut ones They are too dry and thick , I love this product nice clean natural wipes Good price , Wonderful product Hydrates and it cleans Love it , Nobut just no to any cleansing wipe These were very harsh , Product works great Nice removal  however it does feel a bit sticky after but once its dried up it feels replenished , The fullsize pack didnt fry up for me Its almost inevitable for any brand of travel wipes to dry out without an actual seal thats why theyre cheaper so I cant really complain I love the smell I always get the green packs have bought , DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE My face turns flush and burns after use The rose scent is way too heavy and lingers Didnt even remove eye liner or mascara well  photo is as good as I could get it off with literally scrubbing and it wasnt even waterproof makeup Waste of money and now my face feels like its burning  , Almost completely dried out when first opened up Smell is interesting , I bought a couple of packages to take while traveling as I thought the small size was perfect for my trip They were very disappointing They are very dry It took quite a bit of rubbing to get my mascara off and I needed another to clean my face They dont thoroughly clean so I had to wash my face after using them and there was still a lot left on my faceand I dont where a lot of makeup I use mascara and a tinted moisturizer , elles sont bien hydratante avec une bonne odeur mais elles sche trs rapidement , I noticed these have really terrible reviews but I love these cleansing wipes They remove all my makeup perfectly dont irritate my skin and they dont leave my skin feeling oily and gross I use the coconut ones and would highly recommend , The rose wipes smell really good gets off a great amount of makeup but would also recommend using baby wipes as well because it gets off all the make up But these are a great start , Im disappointed in the new gentle exfoliating wipes The old design provided the best exfoliation Ive found Im 75 but the the new one is far too gentle A wet wash cloth works better Ill look for another product , it has oil on it after using them I feel like Im a bit greasy , Barely takes makeup off Smells nice tho not over powering I got watermelon , I used to love these wipes but now they are super dry  rendering them useless They dont even take off my regular nonwaterproof makeup  disappointing Sephora plz fix these , Super small package not a lot if wipes not very moist and doesnt really do anything , They smell great but they do absolutely nothing to take off your makeup A simple baby wipe could do the same sadly I was really hoping that these would work since its a nice value size , Extremely disappointed with the new exfoliating wipes  They dont exfoliate at all  PLEASE go back to the old wipes , These used to be so good and now they are terrible Sephora please bring back the old ones These are dry and useless , I love the convenience of having this on hand I do wing eyeliner 5 of 7 days a week There are times I need to completely do the whole wing again Thankfully these littles guys are compact smell great and are easy on the skin , Not the best at taking off thick  waterproof makeup at all Ive noticed a lot of the top wipes are dry upon opening which means youll go through too many before you happen upon one that does the job One good thing is that these are good if you need a quick wipe if youre not wearing makeup  are wearing light makeup and theyre nice to keep in your car or purseWith that being said there are much better wipes that exist out there and youre better off buying those , Amazing wipes Made my face feel so good I would recommend this to everyone  including people with sensitive skin like me , The old one was way better because this one is too dry , Pretty disappointing wipes Removes about 50 of my makeup and 0 of my waterproof mascara and leaves behind an aromaheavy grimy sticky residue Also these claim to be exfoliating but I dont see or feel that at all , Je trouve quil est collant et je prfre pas collant mais je vous conseil de commencer avec le petit pour voir si vous laimer  , These have a nice scent coconut but I need to use at least two to remove all my makeup and my face just doesnt feel clean after using them I prefer the Julep Beauty wipes , Ive been using these wipes for a while and noticed some changes recently They leave  sticky feeling on your skin  Smell in amazing but this sticky feeling is horrendous , Purchase these for my niece while we where in Las Vegas she have never use wipes before her statement now my wash clothes will stay clean She loves them , Not good make up wipes in my opinion I had to use two or three wipes to remove my makeup , It does an ok job at getting rid of foundation but it does not get rid of my eye makeup at all I usually use this all over my face after Ive taken off my eye makeup It gets rid of everything else pretty well and leaves my skin very soft and clean feeling , I am obsessed with coconut so I was so excited to try these The wipes themselves are OK Standard makeup wipes nothing too special I always get the value size because you get the most wipes Packaging is awful Each time Ive bought the value size the plastic part on the bag completely falls off I havent had that problem with the small size So I have to assume its a manufacturing error Please fix this , This is just pertaining to the large pack coconut havent had this problem with the other types I think the formula changed or the material of the wipe but theres so much left product behind on my face I feel like I need to rinse it off It leaves too much of the cleanser in my eyes taking away from the convenience of the wipes The quality of the actual wipe is good and strong just wish there wasnt all this extra stuff left behind on my face , dont wipe off any of my make up and i use light makeup ive had them for 3 months and their completely dry even though i closed them properly the texture of the wipe is super rough too definitely dont recommend expensive for no reason , not a good product the texture of the wipe is rough and it doesnt clean your face as wipes should , Great addon to a gift even bought one for my self , Was really hoping to like this but as soon as I used it my eyes started burning My fault for not reading the ingredients but it smells really good , Caused breakouts Used for about a week here and there snd ended up getting pimples I never have pimples and am pretty particular about what goes on my skin I love coconut so thought Id try thesenope no thanks will not buy again , these smell nice and are good if you are in the biggest rush but not my favorite  i picked these up after not using makeup removers for a while and WOW i remembered why i stoped using them  i cant get any of my eye makeup off with these and my face makeup barley comes off  they dry out super quickly and make my skin feel dry after use  they can get the job done in a pinch but there are better alternatives , This is a first for me the wipes were dry I carried 2 packs on vacation had nothing else to use , loved this so much  Would def recommend especially for sensitive skin , used to love these Bought a pack the other day and they were so dry hopefully these were just a one off , I bought these thinking they would have the same type of outcome as the rest of my makeup wipes But instead it just made my eyes start to burn To be honest if you have sensitive skin please dont get this product , I love these wipes  No harsh rubbing needed and they leave my face feeling soft and so clean  They smell amazing too , Tried to use these to cleanse my face after sinus surgery  it was a disaster They irritated my sensitive skin  left it red  splotchy even with gentle wiping since these are textured Left a film on my skin that I had to clean off wMicellar water Coconut smell was very chemical and not at all natural Used once  returned Im disappointed in these for sure So not worth it , I 100 recommend the work instantly make off comes off in one swipe I do just wish they gave more in the pack Face does feel a little sticky after If you are looking for cleansingmakeup wipes try these , These are awful New formula is so terrible and it irritates my skin Theyre super dry and dont remove any makeup at all I miss the old formula Whoever theyre never in store or online it sucks The original coconut wipes were the best , Sad to say I will be returning these to the store for a different wipe  The rose wipes smell awful Ive purchased various flavors of these over the years and have never had this issue before  The wipes themselves have always been one of my favorite Sepora productsPerhaps there was a change in for formula , Really dry Ive bought many makeup remover wipes and these are by far the worst ones I have tried Taking my makeup off takes me at least 5 minutes and I dont even wear foundation or mascara , The new formula is terrible Ive purchased these for years as a go to but the new version smells artificial and worse they leave your skin sticky and dont exfoliate or moisturize So disappointing the best wipes changed for the worse , I love the other Sephora wipes and use them regularly I accidentally purchased 9 packages of this biodegradable version and when I tried them I new right away they were different First of all the smell was horrible AWFUL I buy the grapefruit in the original version and love it version has an odd smell that made me nauseous It could actually be the cloth fabric itself that smelled bad Speaking of the cloth fabric it too is awful there is no smooth side But worst of all I had to use SEVERAL of these to get the makeup off and with the original version it takes just 1 This product is definitely a miss All 9 packages were returned , The right thickness and the aloe is soothing for my face after a warm summer day I wish there was more in the package or they sold them in a bundle as i dont think one package can last anyone a full month and that should be the goal , Absolutely AMAZING i got a small pack to  try and it worked amazingly , Bought these while on holidays theyre so good dealt with Alicia in Jersey Gardens , These ones are just bad Too much fake coconut smell and it leaves your face feeling so sticky that i had to watch my face They are going to the garbage , Bought these as I forgot to pack some on a trip These makeup wipes are super dry they felt like they were sitting with the tab open and got all dried out but they were brand new Got my makeup off with some force I found gently dampening them before using them helps a bit with the dryness , I like how these face wipes make my face feel My face feels fresh after use , Wanted to try these out for the size and scent but overall Just ok  they work but I really had to scrub to get my makeup off I will continue using drugstore wipes like Burts Bees in the future , I love these wipes my makeup comes off so quickly I love how clean my skin is after taking off the makeup I recommend this and will buy again  , I dont use for makeup removal but these are fabulous to keep in my bag and wipe off the hot flash sweat that plagues me daily , My favorite cleansing woes Reasonable price and does the trick , They smell really nice and works well to remove all makeup , These used to be the best when made with coconut water but the new formulation is garbage I literally had to scrub this off of my face It wouldnt even rinse off Nasty sticky and the opposite of cleansing Go back to the original formulation Sephora , The wipes are a good size and have moisture but I wont buy them again because they left my face totally sticky I had to rewash to get the sticky feeling off I wouldnt recommend them , These are just okay They smell nice without being overly sweet but the towelettes just feel kind of rough  like I need to apply too much pressure to get makeup off Ill use them up but wouldnt buy again , I love the charcoal wipes theyre my favorite I just wish theyd bring back the full size ones online because the travel size ones are half the size I think they are discontinuing them sadly , Best for combo skin They smell fantastic and remove makeup well , So disappointing They have changed the scent of the coconut wipes and now they are overpowering with fake coconut fragrance They smell so strong and so bad that you have to thoroughly wash your face after using them So sad They were a cultclassicI have been using them exclusively for yearsI had to throw them away , Cant live without the rose cleaning cloths I love that these are extra saturated the rose is calming and smells good Plus the price Use them every day and for everything , The wipes felt great on my skin and smelled just like watermelon and my skin felt pretty hydrated , I like that the sticker used for the seal is adhesive enough that it stays on the packaging whenever Im done using it so the wipes dont dry out as quickly , These are fine but what I really want is the old version of the charcoal wipes , this was a first time purchase and I would definitely recommendgood for taking off sweat and makeup bacteria1010 definitely dont use if your allergic or anything just saying of course , Smells weird and leaves a sticky residue on your face after cleansing It does get the makeup off but not waterproof mascara Packaging is cute , If you liked the older version of this product you will hate this one  They are much drier and you have to really wipe firmly to get them to take off any makeup The previous version was so much better Not to mention these are a pack of 20 instead of 25 like the previous ones So disappointed I will be returning the other 2 packs I bought and shopping around elsewhere for something that does whats its supposed to , I bought this product previously and LOVED it However this content extremely disappointing something changed drastically This formula is sticky and feels sticky when applied to my face When I opened it the first several wipes were dried up It still removes makeup but I didnt feel instant hydration See an immediate glow or feel like my face was revitalized as it had in the past Disappointing but scent remained savory and fragrant , They were almost dry when I opened the package for the first time so it didnt do much for removing make up I NEVER get acne and I got a giant pimple in the center of my forehead within 16 hours of using the one wipe The rest of the package will go in the trash , These wipes used to be my absolute favorite  I couldnt live without them  But whatever changes they made to the formula are terrible  They leave a sticky film on your face hands etc  Nothing feels clean after using these Please bring back the original , These do not exfoliate the old wipes were a staple in my professional kit as well as my colleagues kits , I received this wipes in mail the feeling of wipe is horrible the smell is disgusting i am not satisfied at all so dissapointed the old wipes were great why fix what is not broken the old wipes were great i purchase a lot things from Sephora and would really like old wipes to come back , Love the nonclean version of the grapefruit wipes but they were out the last time I needed to restock They still had the clean ones so I bought those instead How different could they be VERY DIFFERENTThese wipes are horrible The regular wipe has a soft almost cloth feel and is almost dripping with the cleaning solution The clean wipe is like a paper version of a potato sack material and feels almost dry My face doesnt feel clean after using like the regular wipes I never used the exfoliating side of the regular wipes but my daughter says the clean version doesnt exfoliate at all Whats the point of making a product clean if its ineffective That isnt clean thats a wasteDont waste your money Go get the regular version of the wipes , These used to be my absolute favorite and go to make up remover pads  However the wipes have changed and no longer give me the clean exfoliating feeling I used to get when using these pads  Not only do not they not clean as well they are more dry and harder to use when wiping off makeup  I wish they had not changed and would go back to the original ones , LOVE The smell is amazing  theyre so convenient for my gym bag , Not only does this product exfoliate and renew your face and neck it also removes makeup dirt and oils  I highly recommend this for every face , These wipes smell really good and are affective at removing makeup however I do have sensitive skin and my skin broke out aggressively after using , not a huge fan of these wipes they do a decent job taking off face makeup not great around the nose but decent but theyre just not good enough to take off even mascara i usually have to put lotion or other makeup remover on them to make them work on my eye makeup and even then end up having to go back with something else , I love how refreshing the charcoal exfoliating  wipes feel and smell I will definitely continue to purchase these and Ive been recommending them to everyone , These are good cleansing wipes  not sure why some purchasers arent keen on them Theyre moist are thicker than other facial wipes Ive tried and removed all my makeup , The new formula is horrible The wipes are dry  the smell is odd It barely removes makeup Sephora has this bad habit of revamping their already good products to horrible ones Unfortunately wont be buying again , This is good if you just want to wipe of a little bit of makeup but if you wear a full face of makeup on wipe just isnt gonna do the job They feel very dry for a makeup wipe and are really small Wouldnt recommend , Nice travel towelette  It worked exactly how I was hopingremoved all my makeup even mascara , I bought these to try as an exfoliating wipe thats NOT a makeup remover I needed something after running to get the old sunscreen and sweat off absolutely love them , Loved my grapefruit exfoliating wipesuntil now  Had no idea they changed the formula  They now dont exfoliate or smell good  Wish I would have stocked up  Waste of  , Love these they are my favorite Ive tried so many the smell is refreshing , I loved the original bamboo  grapefruit exfoliating wipes from the Sephora brand but since the recent change and rebranding theyre terrible They dont exfoliate at all nor remove makeup and the wipes themselves are more like gauze its so weird Definitely not repurchasing  , Ive used the Sephora coconut wipes for years they were amazing they took make up off and left my skin soft and smooth The new formula is sticky and doesnt take make up off and the new cloths are scratchy Really bummed Sephora you took an awesome product that didnt need to be changed and ruined it Now I have to find a new face wipe , Bring back the original wipes I asked the staff about these new gentle wipes and apparently Sephora changed to a cleaner formulabut its just not the same , Sephora PLEASE bring back the original formula wipes this clean version is so inferior that Im going back to purchasing Neutrogena hydro boost wipes As many other reviews have noted the texture the effectiveness the scenteverything about these is different and not in a good way Now seeing that the old versionformula is sold out of almost every typescent online and that they arent even carried in stores at all anymore is so disappointing , These makeup wipes are my goto I always have a pack of them in my overnight bag and even if I dont theyre so cheapIll just buy one whenever Im out lol I love the smell and Im constantly reaching for these to take off my makeup if Im not using micellar water , I used to love these mainly because of the fragrance Apparently theres a new formula and they dont smell the same Why did u this Sephora Cant trust anyone these days , It is small but Smells nice and it does its job well , Gets the job done however it does seem to dry my skin more , It couldnt remove my mascara and I dont even use waterproof ones might as well be rubbing my face with dry toilet paper , very good product Cleans every inche of makeup and your skin feels fresh , The Rose cleansing wipes have always been a staple for me because the wipe texture and formula worked so well and left my skin feeling clean and slightly moisturized The new formula and wipes are completely different and horrible The wipe texture is more like those flushable toilet paper wipes and the formula isnt as effective and sticky It took me a lot more scrubbing and effort to get my makeup off only to be left with a residue feeling and my eyelids sticking together Please bring back the old version Until then on the hunt for something to replace these , Sephora ruined one of my staple products I used to use these wipes every day but the new formula is just horrible The wipes are now a scratchy gauzy fabric that does not feel good on the skin The wipes were also not saturated with enough liquid They felt completely dry On top of all that they left a sticky residue on my face Yuck I went through the hassle of returning these not for the sake of getting my 6 back but to send a message to Sephora PLEASE bring back the old formula , Works well and smells great I would purchase this again , Great quality and feels refreshing on the skin also take all the makeup really easy , My skin is super dry patchy skinthis wipes works really well for me I have not enough time for my skin routine and carewhen I tried I use this glide cleaning makeup and cleansing my skinlove it , Bought these from my local Sephora Used once and threw them away Wasted 6 on these If you want to use them wetting them helps a little , I really like the scent but I noticed these wipes dry so fast not worth the money tbh , I normally use the coconut cleansing wipes Did not like these at all The texture of the wipe did not get makeup off and irritated my face , Zero stars crap Did a terrible job removing waterproof mascara The mascara barely budged just caused some raccoon eyes My under eyes ended up red from the rubbing as nothing was coming off Ended up having to run to Shoppers Drug Mart to get some micellar water I bought these specifically for a trip as its hard to find travel size micellar water and the Sephora counter woman recommended this , The grapefruit wipes exfoliating wipes have been my favoriteforever Well they just changed the formula or whatever and its totally different The cloth itself is different and just doesnt work the same Its heartbreaking because I loved them SO MUCH These still get the job done I guess Ive only used them a few days But why Sephora why You had the most perfect product This new cloth isnt even as damp Ugh BRING BACK THE OLD STYLE , They do the job and take away makeup very well but Im leaving 4 stars because of the sticky texture they leave behind on your face after using I would still recommend for a nice affordable makeup wipe The smell isnt the best but its something you can deal with , Sephora took a good value product that worked well for years and ruined it These do not remove makeup well especially waterproof mascara and eyeliner Secondly the cleanser in these wipes leaves an oilyfeeling film rather than a fresh feeling Please bring back the old coconut wipes Sephora , Definitely a different formula and texture Doesnt clean as well and I dont know if it was my batch but the pack that I had was quite dry and left my skin sticky whereas the previous version of this product never did that I definitely will not be buying again , Kind of sad they changed these Loved the exfoliation of the old style cloth That said they are still really convenient  and nice , A LIGHT CLEANING I like using these as travel refreshing face wipes But doesnt do much Great scent and good for sensitive skin , smells amazing works greatI find them a tad bit dry but they smell like a coconut beach and they work you can add water to them if they are too dry I like my wipes really wet  , I know these wipes have gotten some bad reviews lately but I honestly dont know why I only use these every now and then when I dont feel like actually washing my face or to clean up eye makeup I dont find them drying too rough or too cheap at all , not buying these again Very disappointing They used to be my go to wipes had the waterme"
Clean Eye Mask,"These are really fun for those spa days with friends Definitely recommend , I love love love this product My under eyes actually feel hydrated I just wish they werent like super quick masks I was kinda hoping for something that was like 15 mins vs this 5 mins Just to relax , I tried this product for the first time and loved it I feel like it made me look more fresh by brightening under my eyesAnd smelled like cucumber  , This is so refreshing and good smelling  I love the smell and how it feels , I find a lot of eye prodcuts dont work that well but this works great I notice a difference my under eyes look brighter I usually pick a few up when I go to the store I like to keep them in the fridge for the cooling effect , this mask is really good and hydrated your skin i always love this mask for my skin , This is not some super fancy mask it cost 350 but for what it is its actually really good I like the smell and the feeling , good product felt refreshing used in morning and had a great glow for the day , Its good I love it it also smells amazing Its the most like legit coffee and I feel fresh and I love it , This is literally amazing for your undereyes it helped lessen my dark circles , love it perfect for under eyes and dark circles love the watermelon scent and their face mask as well is amazing saw a difference in my dark circles in a week of us using , These eye masks are very helpful with the puffiness of my eyes Even though it is only a Sephora branded product I feel that they work a whole lot better than sone of the more expensive brands of eye masks , I used only once but I think I will have to go back to the high end masks Still a good buy for the amount , It smells so good and the cucumber smell is so realistic and it makes my skin feels so much better and and wakes you up and makes you feel good , After I started using this I could see the results in a short time of days I really like it , Je sais certain vont penser que cest dbile mais je mattendais  se quil y en ai 2 paire pour le prix 5 cest norme pour juste a moi jaurais dit 3 pas plus mais 5 cest beaucoup , I LIVE LOVE LAUGH FOR THIS FACE MASK I USE IT EVERY NIGHT GO RUN NOT WALK TO SEPHORA AND GO GET THIS Sephora sponsor me , All Sephora sheet eye masks are very good to use mainly if you look tired or didnt have enough sleep it will add shine and comfort to your look , Clean Eye Mask really does what it should Like it , This cucumber clean eye mask is messy and although it moisturizes the eye area it doesnt last very long  I wound up having to apply my under eye cream soon afterwards , These were very soothing my under eyes have been very irritated red and puffy from allergies these were really helpful I will be ordering some more , Soothing and smells good I usually buy these every so often and for the price they are fairly good and brightens your eyes well , I honestly saw no difference between the before and after Also the way they wrinkle on your face when they dry and both coming sticked together with some weird things to separate them made the experience very weird and confusing overall , honestly i didnt see much difference at first but then i felt my skin wayy much softer , I love these Depuffs so well and makes me feel and look awake , They stick to the undereye well but other than that they dont do much The scent wasnt great and I didnt notice any changes Still felt cooling on the skin but Ill stick with my Patchology ones , Feels good under my eyes especially when I use it when its been in my fridge Smells good Reduces puffiness a little I guess if you use it cold , I absolutely love these under eye masks Work better than a lot of others Hope they come back , This eye mask has helped eliminate puffy eyes  is very cool and soothing , Not a fan There is a protective film on the masks which is so hard to get off After you get the film off you end up having all the serum on your fingers and barely any on your under eyes One patch is thick and one patch is thin not sure if it was just my pack Wont be purchasing again , This made my skin glowy and a lot more hydrated Definitely recommend , This product is very overhyped I left my skin the same way it was before , I thought this mask would be fun to do And it was fun to do but it didnt do much to my skin after I took it off my skin looked just like it was when I put them on so they are kind of overhyped but theyre a cute little gift , Smells like a frap so if that is your thing and Im assuming it is if you bought this youll enjoy the sensory experience Did notice some light temporary removal of dark circles but not as plumping and moisturizing as other products and at 350 a pair you can do way better Tonymoly or Flo economically per pair Every morning I wear eye masks under my eyes while I do my eye makeup I do start with a clean face so I can go right into my follow up skin care afterwards Sephoras eye masks have a lot of serum with them so dont throw out the package right away There is another for a second treatment serum only dont reuse the pads Cute stocking stuffer though , These are very gentle and easy to put on My skin is very sensitive to a lot of skincare products But these are great put them in the fridge or freezer to get that extra cooling effect , my fav little extra step in my skincare routine my boyfriend likes them too , It was ok the smell was nice but the experience was ok not my favorite , super petits masques de beaut que j aime bien merci sephora , produit pas cher et me fais des super de beaux yeux vraiment super bravo sephora   une fois ou deux par semaine , I like trying different eyemasks but these are my least favorite Wont try them again , 35 The undereye patches are nice enough I like their texture and the serum of the patches felt very soothing BUT the cucumber fragrance was 75 too strong , works so well for depuffing  its great bc its cheap and effective , Absolutely love these for special events I put these on while fixing my hair then prep my make up after They make my under eyes feel so refreshed and awake , This hydrated my skin so well and is just so nice and relieving to do , So Ive used these before and loved how they feel for the price But the watermelon one literally just dyed my under eyes coral pink and it would NOT come off with soap and water So after taking these off instead of being bright and deputed  my undereyes were BRIGHT PINK , I always get dull under eyes in the morning after a glass of wine or 3 and my skin is parched This plumped up my under eyes with moisture and brightened them in so fast , The sephora brand eye masks are the only ones that Ive felt that I can really feel the difference afterwards Its really nice that the product disks into the skin rather than just sitting on top of it I highly recommend these , Became a favorite part of my weekend morning routine Very soothing and relaxing , Used the eye mask  I put it in the fridge so it would be cool under my eyes which feels really nice I didnt notice a difference when I took off but it did leave red colour on my skin where the eye patches were , Made my under eye very sensitive and turned it red , This is very refreshing  seriously I work three job all in school college elementary etc and after a long day where many things go inyo your skin after you clean your skin this is like having a new face Totally recommend it , Not really any benefits to using this productJust fun to use , It does really do anything just fun to use  So fun to use , These are the best out of all four flavors Amazing and noticeable difference after first use Im amazed honestly at the result I immediately went and bought 10 more If you are suffering from dark circles puffiness or dryness these do the trick I also loved how bright under my eye looked as well Will be buying more to always have on hand , Feels fresh and relaxing at a good price same with the other flavors , Great when it comes to brightening Ive noticed more depuffing with the caffeine ones But great when it comes to soothing and brightening Also leaves my under eyes feeling hydrated  , Amazing for puffiness and dark circles I notice a difference with using them twice I am such a hoarder when it comes to these eye masks  Definitely worth trying , totally saw a difference in my skin after using this didnt leave a residue either , If you want something cooling and moisturizing these eye masks are for you Other than that they dont really do much and I would argue that if you leave them on for too long that they could be drying to the delicate undereye area I dont regret this purchase at all since I used these during a self care night but theyre nothing to write home about really , I like the smell of this and it actually stuck to my face but I dont understand the hype of these or any eye masks for that matter I dont believe they do much It really is just aesthetically pleasing , Omg I love these I bought a few of these as well as the face mask and they leave me feeling so refreshed , it smells so good i love it i need it every single day in my routine its smells so good , This is my favourite so far Left my skin feeling amazing , Not life changing but they are a cheap cooling self care item that add a little something nice at the end of my day , Dont know if it actually does anything in terms of dark circles since I dont use this on a consistent basis but it certainly feels lovely and leaves my undereyes feeling hydrated whenever I decide to have a impromptu self care night , Actually saw a difference since the first use value , I tried this product a few weeks ago Id been meaning to try it for a while since I get dark circlespuffiness if I dont sleep well Once I finally tried these even though I used it as directed it didnt help at all I still had dark purple circles and puffy eyes I might try one of the other kinds since theyre pretty cheap but Im not sure seeing as this one barely helped , Really enjoyed using this product after a long flight I kept them in the fridge and popped them on after my skincare routine They were refreshing and smelled nice , I bought a bunch on sale other wise id probably skip They are refreshing but there are better choices like the caffeine inkey list eye cream , I use these every now and then or when I feel like I had a notsogreat sleep Its super easy to include it in the morning routine as it only takes 5 minutes to act on I keep them in the fridge so they are always cool when I need them , the product was pretty good it helped keep my under eyes and hydrated and the price was good , Surprised it really reduced puffiness from lack of sleep Repurchased , I love this product This is probably my favorite sephora purchase out of everything I buyevery time I go I always throw these in my cart to keep on hand because theyre not only extremely cost effective but they actually work wonders for your under eye The hydration and caffeine instantly wakes up your face and makes a visible differenceputting these on after a night of drinking or after a night of no sleep will help incredibly to reduce dark circles and puffiness Keep them in the fridge and use them when you need themyour under eye will thank you , Just bought these recently and let me tell you all how great my under feels and looks after one use AMAZING Definitely about to recommend and gift these to my friendsfamily , I love using this product in addition to my skin care routine for a little pick me up normally at night with a cup of tea to get the vibes just right Its so soothing  leaves my eyes depuffed ready for the next day 2 masks 1 for each eye  peel apartddayddaydayiperfetreyourself  M , Works great I usually leave mine on for at least 20 minutes , There are those mornings maybe the day after a party where you want something extra and that is why I like these masks  Theres the whole relaxing ritual of putting them on and listening to chill music  I am not sure if they made a difference but it felt nice and so I like having them  Also I love to give them to friends as part of a hostess gift and everyone has loved getting them , Love these eye masks They feel super refreshing and are one of the few eye masks Ive tried that dont slip down I cant speak to any fading of darkness but I love these as a self care staple , Kind of burnt but did the job and moisturized  depuffed going to try out the caffeine one as well , I really liked the product just wish it came with more than just one set of eye patches , These used to be so so good now they just wrinkle up immediately and cause marks cause theyre so thin I also got hives directly where the patch was which has never happened beforeI would pass on these , Absolutely my favorite brand of eye masks BUT I wish that they came in a container instead of singles , I like the idea of this and the solution smelled good but I found it super irritating on my skin after about 3 minutes I wouldnt say I necessarily had a reaction but it felt extremely drying and it stung , I am loving the results Super confortable and nice , These worked excellent for my under eyes they helped to brighten them and de puff Very impressed with the results , I have been so tired lately and really showing some puffy eyes I used this to try to help and it did but not completely I feel like if this product was used often it could really do the job Smelly great and left below my eyes feeling soft , I have genetic dark circles underneath my eyes and Im always looking for ways to make them lighter This works extremely well and makes them much lighter , They are really functional my skin looks really nice bright and smooth I love this product and theyre super cheap and amazing , I keep a bunch of these in my fridge and apply them when I notice my eyes are looking puffy and tired hello mom of a toddler here Ill apply them and wear them while I get my coffee ready and by the time I start getting ready I look a little bit more awake  , this product is very calming and nice for a spa night or a self care night just wish it were a little more jellylike though , I dont believe these really did anything I bought a bunch of different ones to finish up family facials over the long weekend They felt really nice to have on cool  naturally cold plumpsgives you some freshness IN conclusion nothing magical but definitely can give you a hand if you havent slept much  are looking for that fresh feeling , Luckily these dont have a strong smell especially since i dont like coffee They brightened my under eyes super quickly and the effect also spread to my upper cheeks so its like a mini sheet mask for the face The product is slightly slippery and I used them while getting ready in the morning so they migrated a little I wouldnt hesitate to repurchase them and use them when Im sitting in one place I like how they are a clean product and biodegradable I hope more companies follow suit since having an intensive beauty regimen shouldnt harm the planet , This is a great product Smells nice and fresh Soothe your puffy eyes Love it , cool and refreshing  depuffs your eyes so you look like you had 8 hours of sleep instead of 3 , This is honestly more fun to use than it is efficient I loved putting it on before my skincare routine and while I had my face mask on Its so easy to use and has a great amount of cream left behind in the package that you can massage onto your eye area , I like this eye mask a lot Its quite hydrating and fun to apply I love putting these masks in the fridge for an extra wake me up This isnt left on the face for very long so it isnt going to brighten any dark circles or do anything for you in the long run Overall this is nice to use It does leave a pink tint to your skin from the coloring on the mask but it goes away easily And for the price you cant go wrong , love this eye maskso easy and mess freegreat to throw in with a gift , really nice and hydrating on the eyes after a stressful day , As s general rule I dont like masks like this They never seem to really fit my under eyesBut my dark circles  bags are severe and nothing Ive tried has helpedDecided that Id give this one a goand it is fantastic The serum that the little comma shaped patches are infused in is something that Sephora should bottle The patches are large and slippery  I had to keep adjusting them But whatever is in this treatment really made my eyes look so much better It felt soothing  seemed to brighten my under eyes a bit , Really refreshing and makes the skin all clear I really love the smell of the pomegranate , Didnt do anything except feel nice for the time it was worn , I love this Sephora eye mask so much it totally depuffs  its great to prepare to makeup on , Ive tried so many masks and nothing has ever worked so well I was traveling for over 20 hours with 3 layovers and looked absolutely wrecked but put these on the last leg of my flight and practically became a new person My eyes were so fresh and felt so hydrated If you put them in the fridge before using its even better These have been sold out for a few weeks and I desperately need them back before my upcoming bachelorette party Dont take away the thing I love most Sephora , Love Sephora eyemasks especially for the price This pomegranate one is great to refresh your eye area It brightens it just a bit and adds lots of hydration which is just what I was looking for , i got the cucumber one and it made my eye area so soft and moisturized and did not make my skin too oily nor dried it out all i would definitely use these again , Quick results great value compared to other eye masks and great for travel too A must for anyone The cucumber and coffee ones are awesome too , Cheap and effective I got these to use the night before my wedding was definitely a little scared because Im prone to milia but I was getting married in the desert so my eyes needed the moisture and they worked great No irritation and they were definitely more hydrated the next morning , I dont have sensitive skin nor do i ever break out after using these the ENTIRE area under my eyes broke out severely would not recommend , This face mask is great really brightened up my eyes with the caffiene content great for dark circles mind practically disappeared , Love these for after the shower  before makeup I use the vaccine ones specifically when Im hungover though Works amazingly drink water for best combined results , Best product good for dark circles I will recommend this to girls who have dark under eyes Shows result after one use , Honestly I thought these werent going to work just more of a fun thing to do I was shook by the result My eyes have a thick natural crease under them and after having it on the line was almost gone I cant say that this would would be a long term result if used consistently but I am pretty surprised it worked Great to do if you have an event or if your eyes seem extra puffy one day , Pretty decent for the price and I definitely noticed a huge difference in puffiness and dark circles , Very refreshing and a joy to use during my face routine Not sure about long term results but its nice to pamper yourself and relax , Very cool and makes eyes look less puffy would but again , I used this right after I was sick with Covid definitely helped theyre good for the price Would buy again , I always felt like these things were over hyped but I absolutely love using these on longhaul flights I am not sure what they do really but they feel great and kept my skin feeling nice and plump Theyve become a staple for me when traveling , I opened the package and there was only 1 eye patch inside Otherwise I love the texture of these eye patches , Really nice eye mask I put it in the fridge before using and the results were amazing Cools the eyes and reduces puffiness overnight , its very hydrating but the 2 times ive tried it i havent seen a difference with my eye bags  , Love these I bought a whole bunch of them and keep them in the fridge so that theyre nice and cold when I put them on , These eye mask not only smell good but they work Great price as well Two eye mask come in each pack Follow directions on back You have to peel the mesh part off first then apply gently , I only had one eye mask    I used on each eye for 3 min  i liked the mask just wish there were two , These are amazing Perfect for a special occasion or if your feeling down I usually buy a few and save them for when I think I need a pick me up and these always do the job super nice and smells amazing , I grabbed the watermelon eye mask on sale for a try Im back today to buy 10 of them SO amazing They feel gross  slimy coming out of package but they are absolute miracle workers The wrinkled line under my eyes disappeared in minutes  my skin was soft as satin Will be a goto product for me , This is a great product available at a great price It has a nice pleasant aroma and its easy to use It refreshes and brightens the skin around the eyes , I really like these probably the best under eye masks iv ever used that actually show some result after you take them off and for the price point its a good deal The only thing I dont like is what is up with the quality control Im currently wearing one thick mask and one like almost non existent thin one on the other side the masks are never consistent in quality If Sephora could fix that it would definitely be 5 stars , just used this cucumber mask and maybe yes feel amazing loved chilling it in thr fridge first , Super fresh and cold and relaxing Super stress reducing mask I love it , Stained my eyes pink The added dye is a HARD pass for me , The product itself is fine an average eye mask But there is so much excess packaging for only 1 set of eye masks Not worth it in my opinion , simple easy and cheap does the job well great after a long day to soothe your eyes , These are a great self care treat for a good price I keep them in the fridge for extra cooling I will say the Caffeine mask is the only one that I notice has an effect on undereye bagsdark circles the other kinds just moisturize from my experience , I used this eye mask this morning for the first time as I didnt sleep well have my eyes were puffy and dark circles Popped it in the fridge for five mins then applied to my under eye and instantly could feel it soothing my under eyes I really enjoyed this and my under eyes look alot less puffy and dark  I totally recommend these  , This smell is far too strong it feels like I dunked my whole face into an iced coffee The product also seems to be pretty weak in my opinion and did nothing for my eyes I bought a bunch of these because I was so excited about them and I ended up giving them away because I just couldnt stand the smell again , I like it I dont like that they tryna make me type a long review but I like the product it smells good If youre young and busy this is way better for your Skin then trying to use an expensive eye cream , These are very cooling and help depuff well especially if you leave them in the fridge to cook , Burnt my skin and left massive red rings under my eyes , Overall a pretty good eye mask Definitely something I will get again , Pros  Provides a fun experience for a great price Masks did not irritate my eyes and they felt niceCon  Disappointed in the fact that both the patches were not the same thickness nor the same size , It left huge red patches under my eyes from the dye that it unnecessarily added as an ingredient , Seen visible results for the first use  Happy with this product , While it was cool and refreshing it did nothing for my puffiness , Left my under eyes feeling relaxed and soft I dont know if u can use moisturizer afterwards I didnt anyways and the morning my under eyes felt great , I feel like Sephora products are underrated But they are amazing , Love these for when Im hungover they make my face glow , Love the way my skin feels after and the serum doesnt leave your skin sticky or weird feeling , Dyed my under eyes pink It was hydrating but not worth the money to dye my eyes pink , Must try skin feels so fresh and supple very hydrating , Felt nice on the skin but didnt really do anything at all , Very nice mask Its good for sensitive skin as well Smells great and skin feels soft and bright afterwards , Not a holy grail mask but this is a nice added boost for a self care Sunday routine Will continue to repurchase , I love this product so much For the price it is really worth it I love how ingredients are soft for our skin and its almost all natural Ive been searching for good eyes masks and I finally find the one I recommended it for all of you , I was really excited to try this mask but it only came with one eye patch Im assuming this was a production error , The watermelon mask made my skin bright red I didnt feel any burning or tingling when it was on but after taking it off it looks like my skin is dyed , after 10 minutes and off mask I noticed that my under eyes turned really redme myself a cute raccoon huh But after 20 minutes the color actually gone and pretty nice , I think this is a good quality and price product These eye mask are really refreshing and hydrating I love the healthy glow that they leave on my under eyes , These eye mask help my under eye stay hydrated They someone make my skin red but otherwise I love them , Les masques pour les yeux qui collent le mieux a devrait venir en

and comforting , I bought it for my little cousin and she loved it A cool gift and a good qualitypriced , Cool and refreshing I love to store mine in the fridge for an extra boost Smells great , this like all the other eye masks I got from Sephora are great Good value does what its supposed to do in less time  5 minutes instead of the 1015 with other eye masks Costs a little less than some brands and loads less than other brands so its worth having a stash This like the coffee and pomegranate masks will be on constant replenish , I dont think its a necessity but it is a nice topper It hydrates well and it makes my skin feel super soft I will say that my under eye is less puffy I do believe by doing this often youll see a change rather than a one and done situation I add these mask for fun in my routine and to relay but they do a good job at hydrating , I love it It makes my dark circles look better I would totally buy some more , It smell so good and your skin is so soft for 2 3 day its a good product , Im not a big fan of masks but I really loved these I used them on a girls trip and was pleasantly surprised by the results After a full day of walking we returned to the hotel and applied our masks We really enjoyed the scent sweet but not too strong It was recommended that we leave them on longer than the suggested 5 minutes and Im glad we did Our skin was noticeably smoother and super moisturized Ill definitely get these again , Love these mostly just buy them for fun at sleepovers more then the actual use of them Smell amazing super cute Totally recommend , Clean beauty is a huge thing to me  what is better then knowing youre using it on your eyes with a nice eye mask It was refreshing and definitely took down the bags under my eyes or something to make them look better I love eye masks , Feeling better I looked so tired this is definitely helping every week , Good price and these eye masks are so soothing I especially like them when Im exhausted and puffy Pop them in the fridge so theyre extra soothing , if you your skin to smell like coffee for two days this works great it feels fine and works as intended but the smell of coffee stuck to my skin for two days i only got the smell off by using an electric facial brush and three uses of my cleanser if youre going to buy one of these just the the pomegranate one , Boy do these miss the mark For one they are a bit complicated to apply given they are all stacked together with sheets of protective film and the serum is heavily dyed and will stain everything is comes in contact with So unnecessary for an otherwise basic functional eye mask , honestly i have used this mask twice and i love how it feels on my skin i cant really say if it helps with dark circles since i havent used it for a long time but it smells amazing and leaves your under eyes feeling relaxed and hydrated , I keep buying these hoping they get better but these suck They dont do anything It smells good and its soothing but there are no results These are cute stocking stuffer for people new to skincare or tweens but other than that no , LOVE but does make your eyes pink if you leave on too long , The caffeine eye masks didnt really smell nice Even though I had them in the fridge for a cooling effect I felt a slight burning sensation when I put them on Also the directions say to wear for only 5 minutes What can a mask do in 5 minutes Nothing Save the few bucks and buy a coffee instead At least you can enjoy that , I used these today after another terrible nights sleep pregnant and uncomfortable Do they work miracles No But did they feel cool and refreshing and make my eyes less puffy without irritating my skin yep , i literally love these they feel so niceif any downside they hurt to take off if you leave them on too long , Love these Theyre inexpensive and very hydrating Love , I loved this so much Very hydrating and smelled amazing , works will buy again stayed on my face no breakouts , Recommend by Monica

this one , I wanted to love this but it felt awful on my skin There was a consistent burning sensation that felt painful I normally push through because for some masks a little burning can be normal

roller to make this absorb and stick on better My skin is so glowy and hydrated after using it Cleared up the redness of my inflamed pimples too , smells amazing and is super hydrating i would recommend refrigerating it as it helps cool your face and reduce any puffiness or redness i just like this mostly cause its so calming and relaxing , Isnt mindblowing but a nice random treat and does

definitely getting it again , Good face mask especially for the price I liked how my skin felt after the mask I dont think it was overly fragranced , I was excited to try this mask Other sephora masks leave my skin hydrated and glowing However this one made my skin break out , This mask is not safe for sensitive skin It immediately starting burning and I could not keep it on for five minutes

glow , Luv this mask nothing special than other masks but still i will use this , horrible my face felt like it was burning I didnt even leave it on for the full five minutes recommended on the package the next day I had multiple tiny pimples around my face , This mask was kind of lackluster  The serum was kinda cloudy and broke me out in maskne places  The serum was a little sticky and didnt absorb well , This mask was below average I only purchased it on a whim and probably wont be buying it again It did feel nice on the face but left a lot of residue after taking it off which supposedly you can rub in Plus the smell was so perfumey it took away from the relaxation while using it , It was worth it to buy it Fast result  Ok scent Reasonable price Bought one then went back to buy more , A must have I use this after a shower at night and by the morning my skin is glowing and the redness goes away from acne , I really love these sephora masks for relaxing and selfcare The

from Sephora I use one per week for self care , Lodeur est vraiment agrable et ce produit a trs bien ragis  ma peau sensible , Ok but the mask wins its so smooth and it makes my skin feel so amazing after please buy it its worth it 100 percent , I tried the strawberry type before a special event and found it a somewhat hydrating and relaxing experience although the results werent noteworthy for me The scent of the product was light and pleasant not the sort of weird chemicaly version of strawberry some cosmeticscandleslipglosslollipopsgas station bathroom odor absorbers seem to have So that was a bonus for me I am giving three stars for the nice experience ease of use and cleanup and generous amount of product The price point seems a bit high for what this product delivers in my opinion , This sheet mask feels nice and refreshing on the skin Its nourishing and moisturizing , Loved this maskWill order more products soonLooking forward to more , Very very fragrant and irritated my skin I did not like the fragrance Would not buy again , As a licensed esthetician Im not a huge fan of sheet masks I feel like they dont effectively penetrate the skin the way a classic painton style mask does and that a lot of the ingredients just sit on top of the skin Plus something this fragranced can be irritating Not a fan , Sheet mask with a pleasant light strawberry scent Contains enough serum to moisturize and nourish the skin of the face I would love to try other masks in this series with other scents , This product didnt have to much of a scent which is good it also really helped with my acne The only problems are it wasnt really that mattifying and it stung a bit My recommendation is to not use it on open acne wounds But it was still a nice product , The Sephora sheet masks are always lovely I dont personally dont think sheet masks do too much but its more about the experienceI love the scent and how it feels hydrating , a quick pick me up for your skinI did a patch up before using It didnt irritate my sensitive skinKeep in fridge to soothe and depuff your face , Worse mask ever do not buy It is irritating and not moisturizing at all I could not stand it more than 3 minutes Also smells like clothes detergent Do not waste your money on this , You would have to use this quite regularly in order test out any claims of nourishment and smoothing treatment As a one time deal I would say you arent likely going to see those effects Good if you are looking for quick hydration  Im not a huge fan of sheet masks since they are quite wasteful However if you are looking to do a fun spa day or a quick pick me up for the skin this would work fine , This mask was just okay I dont have any complaints but didnt think it changed my world The price is nice and it would be good for a quick fix or treat , I received this and thought it was a fun little mask It has a strong smell and didnt really help my skin the next day I didnt see any difference but it was a fun little treat Would be good for a girls night in or something , I really liked this mask It feels refreshing hydrating and smells nice Its a little over priced though in my opinion , Its nice for treating yourself spa night My skin was very hydrated but that was it Its nice for the price and Id definitely do again , It left my skin hydrated but thats about it I have lots of blemishes so I definitely need something stronger If youre only looking for hydration then its for you , I really enjoyed using this face mask It fit really well and didnt have any problem with it slipping I liked that it didnt have a strong scent It did well plumping up my dry skin without leaving it too sticky , Hi I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Unfortunately this is not as hydrating for me The Pros  the mask is a good fit and easy to adjust to my face Its a little lacking on the cheek area but I have big apple cheeks   The strawberry scent isnt potent and reminds me of the grapescented erasers I had as a kid As it enveloped my nose it had an undertone of Strawberry tea that was very pleasantThe cons  I didnt see any immediate skincare benefits I also wished there was no Fragrance listed as an ingredient Its listed 12 way through even though I prefer to know what ingredients are in the fragrance , These are always fun but the older I get the more sensitive my skin gets For whatever reason my face gets really irritated with the sheets and they make my skin itch for days after the one use , Delightful Clean Works amazing skin felt amazing Affordable , These masks are a nice and inexpensive way to work in a little personalrelaxation time While I have used most of the these masks I have not noticed any significant difference to my skin though it did help my face feel more like normal after extensive travel I recommend these for those who are exploring face masks duringafter travel flights specifically or as nice additions for selfcare packages , I love sheet masks but cant say Ive seen a huge difference after using this one I like them more for the self care moment and it was refreshing It definitely didnt hurt my skin , Very refreshing and makes my skin feel hydrated Smells good too Good for a self care night , This sheet mask fits my face okay I wish it had the little slits in the sides for a better fit but it did work Its dripping in product so you have a lot to pat into the skin after using It does stay a tiny bit sticky until it fully absorbs The scent is pretty strong if you dont do scents in skincare that maybe an issue for you It feel nice on the skin though and leave it feeling soothed and soft , Cool light refreshing Love this its easy to use and makes my skin feel instantly moisturized No heavy scent its one of my go tos , Dried out my skin rather than moisturizing it I would t recommend this product It was also stinging around the eyes , I have been using these masks for years and I absolutely loved them for a fun extra step in my skincare routine However the last couple times Ive tried them coconut and watermelon my face started stinging and turning red immediately upon putting on the mask Not sure if they changed the formula but super disappointed that a longtime fav no longer works for me  , I have bought a bagillion of these masks I cant seem to leave Sephora without grabbing a couple at the checkout Super fun I always have them so when I host a sleepover we can do masks and no one will question the quality or if my masks are gonna make them break out Smell great kind of big for our faces but thats just cause theyre built for adults Overall recommend absolutely obsessed , Smells great but the fragrance is really strong sheet actually fit my face really well and my skin didnt feel irritated when the mask was on However when I took it off my skin was all red and splotchy and sensitive to touch My skin has remained sensitive and aggravated for days now I dont have sensitive skin and have not really reacted to any products before so I was surprised by this reaction Not sure these masks would be good for someone with sensitive skin , Je recommande ce produit hydrate bien la peau fait une peau toute douce cest mon produit prfr jusqu date dur Sephora  , This mask is a nice refreshing and soothing treatment for the skin It helps me achieve my moisturizing goals for my face No irritation , I received the strawberry mask to review Unfortunately this has way too much fragrance in it so I was not able to try it out because I steer clear of fragranced products on my face If you dont mind fragrance you might like these sheet masks Theyre fairly inexpensive and each scentmask targets different things for the skin , Smells nice but after removing it my face feels itchy , Very refreshing Mask Its hydrating and my skin felt smooth after use Its a bit sticky at first but its gone once its absorbed I recommend this My Instagram arghavanbeauty , Sephora Collection Strawberry Face MaskThis is a thin cotton sheet mask that had a bit of a wonky fit  a little too long at the chin a bit too long at the forehead and the space between the eyes was just a tad too wide It had a light scent that smelled like a mix of strawberry and watermelon to me  which isnt too surprising considering this has both watermelon fruit extract and strawberry fruit extract in the ingredients I did find it a little odd though that watermelon is higher up in the list of ingredients than strawberry is I mask pretty frequently and typically leave my masks on for 2030 minutes but the instructions say these only need to be worn for 5 minutes Since I had a few of these I decided to compare wearing one for 5 minutes the first day and the next day trying it for 20 and honestly the results seemed to be about the same very light tack that only lasted a couple minutes and skin that felt soft and lightly hydratedThis mask was nice  especially for quick masking probably even one of my most favorite Sephora Collection masks and Id definitely use it again but I wouldnt say its anything amazing I also dont like that fragrance is listed so far up in the ingredients Id consider repurchasing it if there was a sale again but I wouldnt pay full price for it , I received this as part of a gift bag from my last order Unfortunately as soon as I opened the package my throat started itching the fragranceparfum listed in the ingredients is the culprit The fragrance is a fake coconut smell Not for people with allergies , Received free for testing  Did nothing but smelled lovely and a mask is a mask  Happy to try it , I enjoyed using this face mask I was afraid the scent would be overwhelming however it didnt bother me at all , If hydration is whats needed this mask definitely will provide it Living in Texas with such an unsteady climate your face really takes a beating This mask was able to put the moisture I needed back into my face , If you watch Dr Dray you know better than to put stuff like this on your face  Not a fan  Just begging for contact dermatitis if you use this , I personally prefer a leave on mask I have tried this mask on a few occasions and I do not care for the drenching feeling of the serum I do like the scent though , This is one of my favorite masks from the Sephora Collection Its easy to use and doesnt slide around It has an amazing smell and it definitely helps with pore size and texture I will always purchase this and keep a few extra on hand , I dont usually do sheet masks but Im glad I got to try this out I love the ingredients and it did leave my face looking nice and glowyhydrated , Using masks once or twice a week is love to yourselfThey dont have to be the most expensive just functional You only leave this mask for 5 min take it off and VOILA  You will feel good Now that Im a new mom I need more masks like this , I am not big on sheet masks but do enjoy them occasionally Sephora masks are usually nice and very reasonably priced Some of them have strong scent that I do not like but strawberry mask is a good one It does have a prominent scent but doesnt feel heady or overwhelming once applied It has just the right amount of serum so you get a well saturated mask but not too much of drippy liquid mess Over all I enjoyed this mask and if you are not sensitive to the scents I will recommend giving it a shot , This is receiving a low review because there should NEVER be fragrance in skincarehair care products The other ingredients are good but whether you have sensitive skin or not fragrance should not be on skin , I use these right after shower or during bath so my skin doesnt get that super tight feeling its super hydrating and not too expensive They also travel very well I used a lot of these during my ski trip when my skin was super dry from skiing all day It feels lux and relaxing love these you can get really good deals on these during the Sephora sals , Smells good  Did slightly leave my face more hydrated but not the best mask Ive ever tried  Just ok , I have found Sephora Collection face masks kind of hit or miss in the past The strawberry variety is lovely though It fits well isnt slimy or drippy and leaves my skin feeling smooth and plump after 15 minutesIts a really reasonably priced indulgence for those times when you just feel like pampering yourself and who doesnt need that these days , I received this for free from Sephora in exchange for an honest review Im not a huge sheet mask user given how wasteful they can be but have tried most of the Sephora Collection ones and was happy to give this one a try It is very hydrating without being sticky but the fragrance is quite strong and artificial which I didnt love I found this mask a bit irritating to my sensitive skin not burning just a bit of stinging which didnt make sense as its meant to be hydrating and doesnt contain any actives to exfoliate etc I like the matcha tea coconut and spirulina masks and would purchase those over this one , I received this product as a free gift from Sephora I dont usually like sheet masks but this one is hydrating and I like that theres a good amount of excess serum in the package for me to massage in the skin after removing the mask I love that this formula as packed with 95 ingredients of natural origin and it smells really nice The sheet is a little large for my asian face but it does the job since it is made of a fiber material so I can adjust it a little to fit I also like that you can purchase these individually for 1 time uses here and there when needed , I received this product free from Sephora in exchange for a product review This mask fits nicely and is well saturated with serum It was lightly hydrating but with only one use there was no noticeable smoothing or nourishing as claimed by the mask My biggest issue with the mask is the scent It is overwhelming and reminds me of berryflavored medicine The scent definitely has berry notes but theres just such a strong disinfectant note to it as well Because of that I would not purchase this version in the future , Im a Sephora Community Ambassador and was given this product in exchange for my honest opinion Of the newly"

This foot mask fit a US womens shoe size 10 but larger sizes will have problems with fit One package contained a pair of booties which made my feet feel moisturized and was pleasant , Leaky was wet

irritated my skin Wont buy again or recommend , I bought a cactus foot mask from the store It was dried out What a waste , Pleasant smell Very easy application process no down time  slip on some slippers and Cary on with household errands visibly brighter skin as well as improved softness Scent is subtle and pleasant , Love the cactus foot mask so much So hydrating found the socks had a lot of room 55W A nice way to relax after a long week , I was super disappointed with this product Bought this to give my feet a pampering  and they are made for only people with tiny feet So they did not get over my heels which was the entire reason for buying None the less I used them for the part of my feet they reached over and while they made my feet in thise areas feel soft for a couple of hours as soon as the lotion had fully absorbed you could not tell I had even used it I have tried many foot masks from various companies and this one is by far the worst one I have tried yet So disappointing coming from Sephora , I actually used this on my son Hes 12 and he needed a pickmeup and was cute and relaxing and produced results  Was great mommy son time and a nice little treat for him  Thanks  , I love these so much Great way to treat yourself after all day on your feet , Really nice Love having a foot bath and then wrapping up in these Good quality and moisturises the feet nicely , Worth every penny My feet feel absolutely wonderful and are no longer dry and peeling , I had a lot of fun sitting with this one on and my feet felt soft and renewed after The one downside is that my feet a just a tiny bit longer than the mask so a small part of each heel missed out on the hydration action Not too bad though for what it cost , This product doesnt work I followed the directions and my feet felt soft for maybe 2 hours after , I guess since I bought this during a sale I cant complain too much but I wasnt overly impressed with the Sephora Collection Coconut Foot Mask Did it leave my feet nice and soft the next morning absolutely thus the 3 stars Did I get any exfoliation Not in the slightest If you can pick one up on sale or if youve got a an extra 5 give it a try and maybe youll have better luck than I did Apparently many other reviewers have Bad to pedicures at the salon for me for now , They fit my feet but busted open on my boyfriends feet  we had to use

have them stocked up , i honestly didnt even really notice a difference , I dont usually use a foot mask but my feet have been very dry and always look like they are in need of some strong foot cream This did NOT disappoint It even stayed soft and moisturized for a few days after Loved the cactus scent , It didnt completely remove the rough skin still had to go in  and file it off but for the price it did a pretty ok job , Ugh I had high hopes for this but I didnt like the smell and it made my feet feel weird while they were in the booties I pulled them off early , Love this foot mask It is so hydrating and feels so wonderful Recommend 1000 , I love these foot masks I will put them on about 12x a month after a shower I usually keep them on for about 12 hours not the 30 min When I remove it I take one off then rub the rest of the product into my foot I always put socks on afterwards too I have dogs and with feet still damp from the lotion I would have furry feet    I would definitely recommend these I get pedicures every couple of months and these help to keep my feet smooth between them , Jadore  Les pieds son frais et dtend vraiment beaucoup  , I got this in their holiday sheet mask collection I bought the set for the face masks but this ended up being a great addition It is scented like coconut which is just okay but this mask leaves your feet super softened and moisturized I used this after exfoliating my feet in the shower I did leave it on longer than the 20 minutes I will purchase again , I keep at least half a dozen of these ready and on hand at all times I love how my feet feel after Highly recommend stocking up because they do run out when you really need it , Few months back was my first time trying this foot mask and let me tell you best purchase I ever made It leaves your feet so smooth I normally do it before bed , Overall this foot mask was really amazing I have dry skin on my feet It did the job by soothing and hydrating my feet

were so smooth after using it I really liked it , Relaxing and hydrating foot mask Perfect FOR right before bed for supple feet in the morning , OMG life changing My feet have NEVER looked better My feet look young again , Cant believe how great these little foot masks are I followed the instructions had them on for 20 minutes removed them and went directly to bed In the morning I was shocked at how smooth and soft my feet were And even at bedtime the following night they were still amazingly soft This was my first time trying a foot mask and after this one use Im addicted Ive ordered a few more I think this will be an essential to have in my cupboard all year round , This is one of my favorite foot masksmoisturizers I have been using it for a while now usually once a week or sometimes once every 3 weeks depending on how dry the weather is I absolutely love the coconut smell , A Treat for me  love these foot masks  I buy them all the time for me and for gifts , These are literally my favourite foot mask They make my feet feel so refreshed at the end of a long day I probably buy one of these guys a week I love them so muchThey are also WONDERFUL at maintaining my feet after a pedicure or a foot peeling mask which SEPHORA doesnt sell , I personally really liked this I wish they had more peeling foot masks available but this one really helped with the dryness I really liked it and would buy again , It makes my feet softI wish there was better instructions on how to use it properly because I had to YouTube it , This foot mask is highly moisturizing and has a somewhat light scent that doesnt trigger my headaches I dont love coconut but its passable Visually it looks like the socks could fit up to a womens size 8 US To maximize results I went all out and did a foot soak exfoliated then rinsed  dried before using the mask This is especially helpful if you have a lot of calluses For relaxation purposes you could just throw these on To minimize waste you can flip the socks inside out after to apply on your feet and lower legs , Made my feet feel really soft The scent is AMAZING if you like coconut was really good for my weekly at home spa night , I loved it smells great and left the feet soft 100100 , Ive used other Sephora foot masks before and they were pretty good but I recently tried the cactus one and it was terrible Maybe I got a defective one but it had very little serum in it and whatever was in there just sat on my skin until I had to just wipe it off , Left my feet feeling so soft and smooth Feels fresh and cool while the mask is on , I wear 9 in womens footwear and the mask was a bit too small broke a little bitProduct is still very nice and hydrating , left my feet soooooo soft I recommend using a scrub before , I buy these all the time I have NEVER had an issue with the booties being too small or ripping Im a size 8 12 shoe These really do make your feet soft after using , Disappointed  These split apart because they were too small  These are made for tiny feet Like seriously its a piece of plastic make it big enough for all women to use  For a company that endeavors to be inclusive of all women this is a pretty big fail , Love this product Makes your feet soft and moisturized , Specifically discussing the coconut foot mask here havent tried other scents For the cost of these masks they are pretty amazing They fit my foot perfectly with a little wiggle room size 6 and they feel very moisturizing I throw a pair of socks over top of the booties to warm up the goop and then watch a couple episodes of something and then take them off after about 45mins Rub in the excess moisture and my feet feel v hydrated after , I really loved this product I am 7 months pregnant and my feet are so tired and sore and this was so relaxing and refreshing to use My feet are SO soft from using it , Obsessed with these I wish I could buy in bulk because I use them once a week in between pedicures , No increase to the moisture or softness of my feet Will not repurchase or gift to anyone , Jai adore lodeur du masque et la sensation de douceur sur mes pieds ensuite Je conseille vraiment ce produit , Made my feet so smooth I would buy again for sure , Love this Will buy again  for sure I have very dry skin and this saved it , Its a good moisturizing foot mask I was happy with this purchase , I bought this mask because Im on my feet all day at work and the shoes are very uncomfortable I needed something that would soothe and relax my feet This is easy to use and left my feet feeling very soft after , Nothing special My regular lotion works better then this mask , This foot mask was very easy to use  It fits nicely on my feet and my feet felt sooo soft , As excited as I was about these they barely fit my feet and they didnt really leave my foot feeling any different then before , While I appreciated the cute cactus patterned booties my feet were not hydrated nor woken up after using these The left bootie barely had any moisturizer inside so it was like putting an almost dry plastic bag on my feet I dont think this foot mask was any better and in fact was worse than putting lotion on my feet then slipping on a pair of socks I would not repurchase this despite the darling cactus theme and previous success with other Sephora brand foot masks , Love this foot wrap its cooling and relaxing on achy tired feet , I really enjoy these foot masks  They soften up my hard heels and big toes and really get me ready for sandals  I highly recommend , Feels great Doesnt leave my feet as soft as I expected but its a nice little mask easy to use , I have size 9 feet and these barely fit Didnt even come close to fitting my husband , Bought the Coconut foot mask on a total whim This is one of those products I didnt think I needed but now that Ive tried will definitely continue to purchase All the moisturizing ingredients are contained in the socks very easy to use and mess free Can wear for 20 minutes or longer as needed After using my feet feel so soft and nourished All the dry spots and callouses I had before are goneleaving beautiful delicate soft feet  These would make great gifts as well Im really hoping they come out with more scentstypes Id love to see a foot mask with Peppermint or CBD , My feet feel so moisturized and soft I will definitely be buying this again I really appreciate the clean ingredients in it , The day I tried this my feet were feeling particularly dry and hot The lotion inside was so soothing and I loved the coconut smell it left behind Also the lotion absorbed more quickly than I expected I will definitely repurchase this foot mask , Super relaxing and hydrating Easytouse and the results are amazing It made my skin so smooth Definitely recommend it , I was impressed by this mask it left my feet very soft and moisturized , Used this last niteleft it on over nite  my feet were sooo nice  soft  smooth Love them , I love foot  hand masks and it sucks that they are not expensive  often sold out But these work amazingly well and have a cute pattern on them super easy to use but youll see here I didnt expect a left and right symbol so I have mine on the wrong feet lol Still worked amazingly well my feet are SO dry so this is a great product to have and you can easily walk around in them Subtle coconut scent I will say the residue is a bit sticky but that doesnt bother me , Ive used these masks many times and they make my feet beautifully soft I love the scent too You can reuse them like 2 days in a row if you want to make the product go further Theyre not environmentally friendly so I try not to buy too often but its such a nice treat , Amazing super hydrating Definitely recommend buying some more now , Love it Very relaxing after a long week of workSoft smell , so hydrating and softening to rough spots smells amazing , I love this its relaxing and actually does make your feet feel more soft Its a perfect way to pamper yourself after a long day of work , Super hydrating  perfect for a spa pedicure at home , This mask left my feet feeling smooth and soft Unfortunately one of them ripped because they were a bit too small for my size 10 women feet , Outstanding I went through chemo this past winter which is drying enough and the treatment made my skin soooooo dry I kept using lotion on my feet but couldnt seem to make a difference Just one use of this mask made a marked improvement So simple to use and they are amazing I will definitely make it a routine thing going forward , I love this foot mask I often have dry cracked feet even after using foot lotion almost every day I try to use this foot mask 12xweek to supplement foot  cream and Ive definitely noticed a difference in texture and softness since beginning to do so , Great foot mask I have both of these scents the coconut and the aloe It is a good scent I would recommend werign them for an hour or two with socks over them to really get the smoothness I use lotion on my feet 56x a day so this helps on the days I am the driest Wish they came in a multipack of like 10 because I love them so much I recommend if you are super dry like myself , Great addition to a Self Care Day Smells amazing and feels great , These are great if you have super dry feet like me I literally am the type of person who has to put lotion on before I put on socks because that dry feeling grosses me out This really does help if only temporarily I keep it on for like two or three hours before I go to bed Trying to walk around with these on though is a hazard so I Wouldnt recommend it but it does help my feet feel a lot better when theyre extra dry I have stockpiled these to get me through the rest of winter , Cactus I had just gotten off my 3rd 12 hour shift of walking over 9 miles a day and had no hopes for this antifatigue mask at all The socks are a little on the thicker side and these ones have the little white dividers inside that you can actually open and put your foot inside I am a size 7712 and found them to be nice and tight with a little bit extra room at the ends I dont think these would fit someone with much larger feet though It definitely felt nice and refreshing but my feet still really hurt After 10 minutes I did notice my feet not hurting as much usually its a really painful aching but it was lessened quite a bit These masks had quite a lot of the gelserum formula However when I woke up the next morning after using them my feet were extremely dried out , I really like this foot mask I bought and used the cactus one and really liked it so I just purchased the coconut one For cactus the smell is nice and clean but not overpowering The socks itself are really strong plastic so you can walk a little without them ripping or coming off I left them on all night and in the morning they were still on nice and snug The cactus one made my feet feel soft and moisturized and made it really easy to slough off rough dry skin on my heels My feet felt cool and refreshed after using as well which was nice I think I for the price and it doing what it says it will you should try this , I usually dont have  pedicures so this works great to soften my feet  The plastic socks are easy to put on and strong enough to walk around a little bit without tearing  They are too expensive to use everyday therefore the 4 star rating rather than 5 star , Skip They smell nice but did absolutely nothing my feet arent softer , I really loved this mask My feet were aching and practically black and blue so I decided to try this mask out for fun After leaving it on for 20 minutes my feet felt super soft and dare I say hurt less I would definitely repurchase these , These are fun to use and make my feet feel a bit softer , Love these masks They smell great leave your feet nice and smooth and are inexpensive Definitely would get again , Unfortunately i havent seen any difference Same as i would have used any other moisturizer Expected more simce its a mask that i kept on more than 20 min , When youve been in and out of lockdown for months a decent pedicure doesnt seem like its in the near future This foot mask will def tie you over keep your heels nice and moisturized and softens you cuticles incase you want to try a DIY pedi Ill be doing them on repeat until biweekly pedicures are a thing again , Received as a gift and will absolutely be reordering I just finished using them and they were so easy  My feet really feel great and the 20 minutes of relaxing with them up was awesome , I really enjoy a good hydrating foot mask any time of year they are cooling soothing and softening  love keeping these on hand I did receive this in gratis for my review  I do recommend these also great after a nice foot spa or pedi , I love these foot masks I treat myself after spending a lot of time on my feet a long hike a stressful day or whenever my feet feel dry They are easy to use and leave my feet happy and baby soft I give these as gifts and rave about them all the time , Really enjoyed this feet mask Lately my feet have been really dry but when i used this feet mask it helped my feet feel really soft and get rid of any dryness Also the smell is really nice After using this mask Would recommend this , Cold weather makes my feet and hands very dry and these masks have help me so much during winter They are like socks with moisturizer inside I always wear them for longer than the suggestion time because I love them and it makes me feel Im in a spa , For a self care treat a home spa day this is perfect The feeling of having sticky ziplocks full of cold unkown liquidy is a whole experience The result is nice  , I really like to use these to moisten the heels of my feet and then I use tools and the excess skin just comes off so much easier Its great for athome pedicures , BEST PRODUCT EVER It was so relaxing to do and made my feet so soft after , My skin is so dry from head to toe during the winter so Im always looking for soothing fragrance freeclean healthy moisturizers but sometimes our feet need a little help It says to leave these moisturizing socks on for 20 minutesI left them on for an hour and my skin soaked up everythingthere was nothing left to blend or rub in and theres a lot of product in these packets I got the cactus and my feet felt pretty good afterwards just like they do after I apply my normal moisturizer I think the price point is worth it to get to kick my feet up and soak in these for an hour actually felt so good Perfect way to relax and get that extra little kick of moisture that my feet needed , I purchased this as a gift and I have no doubt that this will be loved My mom always loves the sephora collection foot masks This is a great stocking stuffer or gift add on I got the cactus one which is supposed to hydrate For 7 I do wish that it came with 2 pairs but thats just my opinion Doesnt affect the overall quality of the masks , These type of foot masks are hard to find and a good clean brand too  Easy to use and kept my feet soft 24 hrs  Weekly use would make for great feet  Will buy again  Also smell amazing not sticky , I left this on for about 25 minutes i had to order more while I was doing the mask itself 1010 I suggest My feet were so soft and smooth   , Not sure why all the products is at the front of the mask Tried to wiggle as much as possible once it was on to get the product to spread to my heels and no luck Also 1 broke as soon as I put my foot inside Had to tape it and put a sock on so it would stay on , Ive never used a foot mask before so I became very interested in trying it The concept is quite unique You could sit on the couch or lay in bed with your feet in these sleeves and your feet are supposed to come out very soft hydrated and smooth rightDidnt turn out that way The flaw is that the foot sleeves have the moisturizing cream at the very front and slight middle of themabsolutely none at the back where the heel is My feet arent even one of those extreme cracked feet or thick calloused skin Its just average dryness on my heel and since there were no cream at the heel area of the sleeves it was doomed to fail I did try wiggling my feet around in the sleeve after I used the tape tab to try to work the product towards my heel It didnt help After 8 minutes I added a bit of water into my sleeves to get the product to spread more I finished out the 15 or so minutes and my feet were only a tiny bit softer but you could still see some dead skin there I then had to soak my feet in the tub which defeats the purpose of this product just to scrub off the dead skin from my heels I shouldnt be surprised though The coconut ingredient in this product is near the very bottom For it to be called a coconut foot mask it should be higher concentrated and include more cream throughout the entire sleeves and not just the toes This doesnt have only 1 star because it made the front of my feet a LITTLE softer yet did absolutely nothing for my heels , Bought this for my boyfriend to try because he has incredibly dry feet and it didnt fit  Should be considered for womens foot size 9 or smaller  Also didnt see improvement to skin dryness for the part of his foot it did fit on , Made my feet feel nice Would buy again But 7 ouch , After a bath I put these onUnfold and split the plastic socksthey are labeled left and right Be sure to separate the lining inside before putting foot inthis where the good stuff is Then I put a pair of heavy cotton socks over to avoid slipping And wear them while I sleephappy feet in the morning Just rub the rest over your feet and lower legs , I exfoliated my feet first and use this for moisturizer every week Now my feet are softer than my face , Coconut one is great but the cactus one just left my feet extremely sticky , loved this similar effect to paraffin wax It helps a lot with dry skin , I cant speak to how moisturizing these are yet BUT they are easy and mess free to open and apply Even better they come with stickers to lock them closed around your ankles Most foot masks I have used in the past have not had this feature Huge win for me with ease of use and lack of mess My feet get really dry from wearing a lot of sandals and going barefoot This is a nice treat yourself and easy to do for the price They also smell amazing Who doesnt want that before bed Worth it if you ask me , These are okay I dont think theyre the most nourishing masks and they definitely wont heal severely dry cracked feet but they can be a good gobetween lotions and creams , This was so amazing on my feet I plan on buying this gain very soon , Great scent and moisturized my dry feet to look baby smooth , Moisturizes your feet for sure and is a nice little ritual but if you suffer from really drycracked feet this isnt a remedy for that My feet felt the same as they do when I just moisturize with cream , These are like little lotionfilled socks that you slip your feet into and theres a little plastic sticker latch to tighten it around your ankle and prevent it from sliding all over the place Such a simple design but so pleasing 3 My feet definitely feel softer after use and its an excuse to kick my feet up and relax for a few minutes , 4 Star packaging size of the boots easy to apply not too much fragrance whch I like Missing 1 star It saya Antifatigue on its description dont really feel much difference My feet is not that tired so not sure for others if they did feel the difference But it made my feet soft , This is great

dry from being out in the sun and working on my feet a lot The price is so reasonable too  This is a MUST HAVE at home since I cant get a pedicure , This are amazing They smell so good and they are so easy to use Not messy My feet felt so soft after the first use and I loved it I dont mind sitting there for 20 min with this on its sooo relaxing I need to get my hands on more of them The only thing

was worth sitting through the 20 mins for It was easy to put on and not messy at all I dont suffer from dry feet but this just made it feel so smooth and soft that I feel the need to try it again Loved it in a weird way , These foot masks are great Very moisturizing Sometimes I leave them on for even longer than 20 mins The only thing is that theyre not for big feet My husband also loves these and they often rip on his size 12 foot , Foot packs were leaking through the packaging I did use them but they were just bleh It wasnt any more effective than using a good lotion Doesnt really penetrate the skin well enough to warrant even a 2 star rating If youre looking for good foot masks try Tonymoly Im Lovely Peach Way better than this waste if 20 minutes , I loved the Cactus Foot Mask  Each foot wrap has a fiber lining generously saturated in product and the outside is plastic with tape tabs  They stay securely on your feet and there is no mess or leaking  I found the scent to be very pleasant  They made my feet extremely soft and smooth and took care of the dry skin on my heels and the back of my ankles  I would definitely purchase these in the future its an easy no mess way

want to walk on these , I tried this feet with doubts of its efficiency It contains a pair of plastic socks which can be secured on your feet to avoid mess I wouldnt recommend to walk around while wearing them just take a moment to sit and enjoy itAlthough its slightly scented it was very pleasant and didnt cause any reaction It left my feet skin and rough heels feeling hydrated soft smooth and fresh I would definitely repurchase it , This is a super cute fun and effective mask  I used it when I was doing an athome pedicure and it was super easy to put on  Be careful walking with these on your feet because they are slick but they stay on very wellEach sock is individually sealed within the package and are labeled right and left because of the location of the adhesive strips  When I first opened the sock I was confused because within the sock there is one layer of soft cottonlike material soaked in product which only covered half of my foot but once the sock was sealed the mask fully coated my feetThere is a "
Clean Hand Mask,"Very strong 90s cucumber scent Felt tacky for about 20 minutes despite rubbing in the excess Noticed no benefits cheap hand cream delivered more results instantly , I have  crazy dry hand in general but it gets even worse with colder weatherThis mask saved my hands it is so refreshing hydrating and nourishing it really feels like a little luxuryHonestly get it even if it aint cold outside anymore , It works for that moment only feels nice and soft for a bit then you go back go normal dry skin , Loved the mango scent and depending on your dryness level it may take a few uses with each single application But I would recommend to do this at night or before bed as so youre not washing your hands throughout the day , To start with the scent is awful I could not get rid of it no matter now often I washed my hands My hands felt the same after using this as before Total waste of time and  , I use these on my husbands hands He works construction and I use these once a week on him They work better than the high end ones , Had my hands soft for two hours or so and smelling like mango which I love But sadly it did wash away quickly due to washing my hands so I think maybe it should be sold with like twothree in one pack for the price but either way I loved this self care hand mask because I use my hands for everything I do it was a good day for a me day  , Very friendly user My hands got really soft The only con is the smell Its a really weird one it smells like rotten cucumber I would have prefer something more floral or anything else than that l , The cucumber scent of the mask is very strong and unpleasant It gave me a headache I tried the mask on anyways And the scent remained on my hands for a long time even after washing It did make my hands feel soft but it wasnt worth it , Works pretty great After spending too much time washing dishes this worked well to moisturize my hands They felt smooth and helped relieve the dryness on my knuckles and back of my hands It is sticky after removing the mask but after a few minutes it settles and hands are left smooth Scents and patterns are cute and fun especially for a spa day Would definitely recommend , Nicest hand mask Ive ever tried My hands were soft for days after 1 use , The scent was too strong for me that I almost gaged I had to wash my hands multiple times to remove the odor I dont recommend this product , These help to soften and moisturize When you remove them your skin appears sticky as if a film has covered it Sometimes the smell bothers me at night as I have a sensitive nose Dont leave it on too long ie an hour or longer as it can cause redness Ive also washed it off 15 minutes after leaving it on and that works well also The gloves can be reused multiple times so they are of good value , I purchased these to try during the Holiday Promotion the cucumber scent Its so moisturizing easy to use and clean to work while wearing the gloves My hands feel so soft after 15 mins Id recommend and already bought more , tried these for the first time and loved it another item I add to my basket , Love these  I put it on when I go to bed and when I wake up my hands are so soft and moisturized  A staple in my selfcare , These are super easy to use and not messy at all The masks themselves are very cute and are fun but I wouldnt say its a necessity just a fun thing My hands arent big but these felt a little snug Also the day after I used these my palms of my hands were dry and flakey I wont repurchase , My hands felt so amazing after using this hand mask Im a Registered Dental Hygienist and I wash my hands so often my skin gets parched These are so nourishing 1010 would buy again and would definitely recommendAlso side note  I have very sensitive skin to scents and various creams and this product did not irritate or anything , I love this hand mask so much I do my own gel manicures weekly and removing with acetone is so drying on my cuticles This hand mask has been a lifesaver It is also the best fitting hand mask Ive ever tried I have small hands you can actually do stuff with the gloves on unlike some others Ive tried I prefer the Mango scent to the Cucumber but both are very hydrating I will buy this as long as Sephora keeps making it , This product is really sticky once the gloves come off Your hands stay sticky after they dry It doesnt moisturize like I hoped , I thought the gloves would be made of sheet mask type material but these are thick plastic and my hands were warm and sweaty inside the whole time Afterward my hands were sticky like they were covered on glue Overall so unpleasant its not worth it , This hand mask was absolutely wonderful Moisture and softness for dry hands With the weather so hot it was nice to pamper my hands , I havent personally tried these yet but my boyfriend is obsessed with them They leave his hands soft and smooth and he loves the scent When I try them Ill update with my opinion , I have mild contact dermatitis  eczema on my hands that acts up once springtime rolls around and goes away in the autumn and I wondered if these hand masks would provide some relief While of course the eczema didnt go away entirely it did provide itchiness  dryness relief to the point where I almost forgot about those patches on my hands since they stopped being so irritated I think Ill try the cucumber one next time , I have become addicted to hand masks lately so trying all of the brands I can find  These were ok the thumbs had no product so had to put my thumb in one of the fingers to get some product  i didnt notice much of a mango scent  They are probably the most expensive ones I have tried and probably the one I liked the least definitely would not repurchase , I love hand and foot masks I hate face sheet masks so much It sucks that they are so expensive  often sold out Sephora prints these super cute patterns out too so its fun all around Super easy to use these ones even include a left and right Definitely hydrated  nourished my hands but the residue is a bit sticky Love the subtle mango scent as well If you have the funds I would definitely recommend these  , I love all the hand and feet masks by Sephora one thing to note is the hand ones leave your hands sticky for about 5 minutes after you rub in the product so you have to be patient and let it dry However there is no stickiness with the foot masks , Totally recommend this hand mask I got the mango flavor one My hand is always cracked dry due to working in the kitchen Tried it for the first time My hand felt so smooth after using it Also got rid of the hard parts on my palm Will definitely get more since it is helping my hands feel normal again , I absolutely love this hand mask It makes your skin so soft and smooth Smells great without being too strong Highly recommend , This Hand mask is worthless Probably I had an high expectation of the mask but I am disappointed after I used The instructions say no rinsing However it stays sticky , i like masks of all kinds  i didnt find that this treatment worked any better than a nice rich hand cream applied at bedtime with cotton gloves  it was meh for me and will not repurchase , Very hydrating My hands tend to dry out as I work in the medical field and often wash my hands and wear gloves , This didnt do anything at all for me My hands are extremely dry due to winter  COVID hand washingsanitizing and I hoped that this could take the place of Dr Jarts hand mask which was amazing but seems to be discontinued Sadly it does not I tried it twice and didnt notice any difference either time , Yeah no Dont do it It has a weird smell and my hands are just sticky Who would want to wait 15 minutes to be like cool I have sticky hands , I had such high hopes for this product I think with covid many of us have been sanitizing their hands like crazy I used this mask yesterday to try and inject some moisture into my hands and I havent seen any difference at all Hopefully this works better for other people but for me it was a bust , I work at a hospital and sanitize my hands countless times a day which combined with the winter weather has really wrecked my hands After using the mask last night my hands are SO MUCH SOFTER and generally healthierlooking Definitely adding this to my regular arsenal , I love hydrating hand masks they are great while you sleep to hydrate very dry hands from sanitizing and harsh water and cold weather and dry heat great especially for winter season , Not only am I washing and sanitizing my hands constantly we all are but Im also 45 years old and my hands are starting to show signs of aging Im the kind of person that only leaves reviews if a product or service really WOWed me and these glove masks did that My hands looked like someone had taken a blur tool to themlike they were photoshopped Seriously I was impressed It lasted like one day but for that one day my hands were 18 lol , I work as a cashier and need to use hand sanitizer and cleaner a lot lately My hands are dying in pain flaky and started to split open near the nails I tried this to hydrate my skin Love it After one use my hands look like new Smell great as well and it feels so fresh , My skin on top of my fingers are beginning to chappeel I tried this mask and after 1x used i feel the difference the chapped skin on my thumb is somehow still visible but not hard skin anymore It says on the instruction use twice a week maybe to really see and feel the difference Since I got this as a free sample Im glad I did tried it , Saw this on sale so thought Id give it a try despite the bad reviews I wash my hands more than 50 times a day as Im in the healthcare industry so am always needed extra moisture for my dry ugly hands Its not so much that this product cant be rubbed in after the 15 min treatment Its that this product NEVER moisturized my hands in the entire 15 min plus I had the gloves on My hands are still just as dry and ugly Other products work MUCH better including the aloe vera hand mask they used to sale Fifteen minutes would work a miracle for a week on my hands with that product  Dont waste your time and money on this product like I did Believe all those bad reviews , The Gloves come super saturated they smell amazing and my hands are pretty soft after I like to put a hand cream on after to lock in all of the hydration , My hands have become so dry due to excessive hand washing during the pandemic I have tried to treat my hands with so many hand lotions to repair them but it hasnt helped much I decided to try this hand mask and Im very pleased with it After just my first use my hands are so soft and hydrated I cant believe the improvement it has made after 15 minutes The mango scent is delightful Treat yourself to this hand mask and you wont be disappointed , Left a sticky residue on my hands and the moisture was no more significant than a typical hand cream , With using stage constant use of hand sanitizer and washing my hands this item was exactly what my hands needed to feel soft and hydrated , Three and one half stars I didnt really care this item not because it isnt a good item but because it didnt really deliver the results I expected based on the description I have small hands and gloves would  slip and slide all over the place Though they feel nice on they wouldnt stay put and left a mess once I removed them Bummed , I had it as a sample to test and review it Not bad but the fragrance is just not for me but If you dont mind strong fragrance its fine , This is a great product Used it before bed and rubbed the serum in afterwards and woke up with smooth hands It has a light cucumber scent and theres a band to secure the gloves too , With all the handwashing and sanitization my hands were in desperate need of relief and this really worked Id recommend wearing overnight for best results 15 mins really isnt enough time for an effective treatment The gloves are very comfortable and dont get in the way when on I could even use my phone the whole time with no issue It does take long to absorb into the skin when you take the gloves off and does get a bit tacky so I prefer to rinse off the excess gel My hands looks plumper and felt more hydrated after Smell is light and refreshing I tried the cucumber version maybe the smell complaints were for the mango one , My hands werent dry prior to using this but it made it feel super smooth and silky afterwards Its a different experience and feeling from hand lotion and Im glad I tried it Nothing bad to say about this My hands are baby soft , Will be getting more of these The smell is very pleasant without being overpowering There is a good amount of product inside to absorb and rub into the hands afterwards Comfortable to wear Great to use after a day of hand washing and using hand sanitizer , The residue cream doesnt simply rub into your skin Stays on and is very tackysticky , These really work My hands feel smooth and silky even the next day They were sticky feeling right after using the gloves but that didnt last long These do generate a lot of trash however as each sheet mask style glove is also wrapped in a plastic glove , The cucumber hand mask made my hands very soft and smooth  It put the hydration back into my hands that constant hand washing has depleted  It was comfortable to wear for the 15 minutes and there was no mess or leaking  I love the cucumber scent I didnt think it was overpowering but I happen to love the scent of cucumber  It does however leave a tacky residue on your hands until you wash them  I would purchase this cucumber hand mask in the future because the hydration you get from it is better then any hand cream I have tried , I received this mask free for an honest review the cucumber one I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these gloves I tried them on after a day I used my hands a lot cleaning and cooking so my hands were quite dry The mask really restored the skin hydration and my hands looked happy As there was a lot of product inside I put the used gloves in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge I would not do this with a face mask but I think its fine for the hands The second time it was very well it was enough product even for third time but I didnt do it The mask itself is really sticky so there is no way to leave it on the hands When you tie the cuff dont do it too tightly as it would be difficult to remove , I received this product as a free sample for my honest opinion The gloves are made of a plastic exterior with a fiber lining soaked up in a gelserum type of moisturizer It left my hands very hydrated and soft The texture is more of a sheet mask a serum gel lotion that you have to rub in I have severely dry hands and decided to follow up with a moisturizer right after I did this routine right before bed to make sure I wouldnt wash the product off My hands were almost completely healed the next morning I agree with the other reviewers saying it stays sticky I would recommend this at night before bedtime only BUT after all of this do we really need another throwaway single use product to moisturize our hands I hope Sephora finds a way to make a compostable glove or reusable one This whole concept is so wasteful Cotton gloves with a good moisturizer does the trick for me I think if they do a kit with a serummoisturizer and reusable gloves thatd be amazing If you dont mind about that part its a 5 star product used correctly , Im so surprised These were definitely super weird to wear but honestly kind of a nice at home spa thing I didnt find them sticky unlike other reviews but I did rub the excess product in and took what was left and put it on my elbows and knees and allI used this last night since I noticed my moisturizer wasnt cutting it and today my hands still feel hydrated  , I liked the idea of this mask but it left my hands feeling sticky and tacky It almost feels like having a sticky self tanner on My hands felt softer after but I had to was them as the tacky feeling persisted for at least 15 minutes after  I thought it might be more of a lotion texture but it was a gel , I received this product as a free sample from Sephora to try out I sampled the cucumber mask The masks are plastic gloves that can secure at the wrist with little tapes The gloves contain fabric lining soaked with product They are recommended to be kept on for 15 minutes Upon removal it is recommended the product left on hands be gently rubbed in However the product leaves an extremely sticky feeling that is not particularly pleasant In a time such as this where constant hand washing and sanitizing dry out the skin the moisturizing effects of this mask are welcome It really does a good job bringing moisture back Those effects earn this mask 3 stars It lost 2 stars due to the stickiness left behind , This is the first hand mask that I use and it was an amazing experience I will be buying these often I am in my 40 so my skin needs special attention and the hands are often forgotten My hands are dry so this mask was exactly what they needed PROS  Saturated with product so you have more than enough to treat your hands for even more than the recommended time I had them on for quite longer  It fits the hands nicely for a one size only  My hands were left deeply hydrated and plump  Clean at Sephora  They come in a plastic glove so wont make a mess while on CONS  It took long for the product leftover to absorb once removed While absorbing your skin will feel tacky  Has perfume as an ingredient What is a pro for me can be a con for someone else I love scented products but not everyone does so if you dont like perfumes stay away from these  If you dont have dry or aging hands you probably wont feel any difference after using these masksThank you Sephora for sending these my way to try and provide my honest opinion , I thought this would be fun  so I used as directed and left on 15 mins Then I took off and rubbed the rest into my hands as it says no need to wash off just rub in It was sticky stinky and all over kind of gross I use tons of lotions and moisturizers and this would not be something I ever try again Also the price point is ridiculous at 7 Sorry not for me , Received this in an exclusive package and my fianc saw it and grabbed it so quick from me Haha hes a welder and hes got some rough rough hands He used it last night as I watched and my thought are this the smell is a little overpowering but if you like cucumber then thats fine My fianc has no problems putting it on and then taking it off It did leave a little sticky residue he has to wash off but then his hands felt so so soft Secondly I know everyone might freak out about the alcohol in these but Cetearyl alcohol is a fatty alcohol and does not dry out the skin So , I received the cucumber one While I appreciate the clean ingredients I do wish that alcohol and fragrance werent as high on the ingredient list as the fruit and flower extracts This does contain glycerin and Hyaluronic acid so it will certainly hydrate the skin and help it hold on to moisture , Im not a fan of cucumber scented things but I didnt find the scent bothersome What I didnt like was how sticky the mask made my hands I rubbed it in after I took the gloves off but it was still very sticky so I had to rinse it off That being said my hands do feel softer But I cant stand the stickiness , Very very fragranced just a heads up But with that said it works I work at a restaurant and as a result am constantly washingsanitizing my hands throughout the day I use this for a pick me up for my hands and it really made them softer the next day I could physically feel the difference I know people have alcohol concerns with this but if youre sanitizing your hands constantly then whats the big deal Effective sanitizer is 70 alcohol And apparently this one isnt even the drying kind of alcohol Im not an expert on ingredients but I do know my hands felt softer and more hydrated the next day I would repurchase every now and again for a little more hydration for my hands , Cetearyl alcohol is a fatty alcohol and is not drying to the skin So do not be concerned I am a licensed esthetician and know that people do not always know the difference between good and bad alcohols Fun way to soften the hands Will definitely repurchase , I wish this product didnt contain so much fragrance and drying alcohol look at how high alcohol is on the list You could smell the fragrance miles away If you have sensitive hands or dry hands I do not recommend"
Clean Hemp Mask,"The clean hemp face mask felt very hydrating once I put it on and left my skin smooth , Refreshing mask but the smell is so gross I had trouble keeping it on B , I really enjoy taking care of my skin and all of the aspects of skincare This mask feels so good against the skin and the smell is faint and not overbearing I definitely prefer the gel texture over the paper masks When drying the mask becomes lighter and feels good on the skin too I would recommend you give this mask a try dont be afraid of hemp , Love this face mask its the best totally worth it definitely repurchasing again , So i used this on clean skin before bed time The next day i noticed break outs i have clear naturally the second day it was worse more break outs I had like 5 huge white heads on my nose I never get pimples like that Wouldnt recommend , Made my face itch and very dry Dont like this mask but the watermelon one or pineapple one is good , I found that applying this was a bit tricky possibly due to not thoroughly reading the instructions or not being able to wear my glasses It was different than the masks Ive used in the past because it sorta absorbed into my skin and it was lovely to have on during the waiting time My face was baby soft afterwards and the entire process was a pleasure Definitely recommend this to anyone , This is a mask unlike any Ive ever used before It did have 2 films on it I peeled 1 off and then laid it on my face and made application super easy instead of mask folding in on itself It smelled really good to me The thing is the longer it sat it was like it was melting into my face Like becoming one with my skin Sucked itself right in Most masks just sit on top of your skin but this became my skin Doesnt feel like a normal sheet mask either but also didnt feel like a gel mask Its hard to explain I didnt want this mask but it was cheap and got me free shipping and now I think I would buy again for sure Using at bedtime so I cant say anything about the mattifying but I like it Its almost like it turns into a peel off mask its so sucked into my skin , So excited to try this product Packaging was so cute and came just as expected Update LOVE THE MASK so soothing and didnt leave any gross residue on my skin , I give it a three because I wasnt a big fan of how it smelled tbh  Over all it left my skin nice and smooth  6510 , This made my face feeling absolutely refreshed and good and smooth I recommend 100 , At sale price i found it very worth it Its not a sheet like normal sheet masks it is like a gel sheet and it feels awesome It doesnt slide all around on your face like many of the reg sheets and it lays pretty taught too without wrinklesfolds My skin has been very dull and had an unusual amount of acne lately It smoothed my skin and made my skin look much happier My acne i thought may get worse since it isnt a cleansing mask but i washed my face before and rinsed after and my acne is actually better i dont think the mask made it go away but it definitely didnt make it worse I dont like paying more than 35 for a single mask so at 350 i found it worked really well Smell is mildpleasant and not fragrancey , Whoa Skin was flawless after using this Quite surprised by the results Ill be buying plenty more , Matte without being dry It was really nice and it fit my face well , This mask is hydrating and easy to apply on the face It fits well and gel type of mask I would buy again because its a gel and very durable material , By far not my favorite face mask from Sephora The texture is gross and almost gel like The smell of the mask is unpleasant I wanted to take it off as soon as I put it on I waiting about 15 minutes or so didnt feel much of a difference Wouldnt purchase again honestly , As an oily and acne prone person I loved this mask I felt balanced and matte but left the skin feeling supple at the same time I would repurchase this during a hormonal acne flare up again , it feels really good on your skin definitely recommend , Loved how my skin felt after using this product The only negative thing Id have to say is that the scent of the mask was not good at all , The mask while at first visually unappealing is easy to use and left my face feeling hydrated and refreshed , This is a complete waste of money i have dry to normal skin and this did not do anything for my face Infact the mask itself came in a weird shape that did not cover the whole surface area , Big Fan I love to use this after I exfoliate and it immediately calms down my skin I also deal a with scarring from acne and Ive noticed theyre no longer as red or inflamed looking Definitely will be buying again , Only temporary Hydration and you will look like a swamp creature while wearing , Really love this hemp mask Its a jelly mask with a cooling and refreshing feel I use CBD skincare products currently and love them Using this hemp mask is a nice addition , Reshreshing Serum feels great on the skin a little hard to place around the lip area due to size of hole but otherwise I recommend , This mask was better than I expected For reference I am in my 40s and with dry skin due to the use of tretinoin Being a mattifying mask I was expecting for it to dry up my skin but no It left my skin feeling very hydrated and soft I loved it It smells very good although I prefer skincare with no perfume because it does not add anything good and it can irritate sensitive skin The package comes saturated with serum so make sure you dont throw the package without using all that serum I saturated my mask after I put it on and use the leftovers on my neck chest and back of hands All baby soft right after Great mask , Mask was nice but its sooooo small  Barely fits my entire face , Relativement matifiant mais la senteur est horrible , its a very fragile mask that falls apart right out the package The serum worked really good I stored the extra away for another time , Amazingly priced and very refreshing left my face feeling cleansed and not too greasy or dry It was a perfect balance , This mask has a consistency like rubber instead of fabric just as the Sephora Freezing mask did This allows it to adhere well to the face so you can easily walk around and do other things I did not find this mask to be as moisturizing as some others It did a moderate job but nothing blew me away I also did not have the same brightening effect on my skin Reduced puffiness as I did keep it in the fridge prior to use I wish Sephora would bring back their Freezing mask as it was superior to all others in every way , I have very oily skin so I was excited to try a mattifying mask that Sephora just released Also Ive never used a hemp skincare product before Tearing open the package the juice squired out on my left arm I didnt mind it because I love juicy masks to deep clean my pores The mask comes folded in 4 It has plastic on the front and back of the mask that you have to peel off This isnt a normal fabric sheet mask This is a wobbly green gel one You can see the Camellia Sinensis Leaf stuck to it I like that its a unique looking mask I didnt like that the nose and eye area wouldnt lay flat and contour to my face Also the mask isnt wide enough to reach the jaw area like Sephoras other sheet masks do This only covers half of your cheek I know because I used a different one yesterday and it covered my entire face without any problems I see why it says to keep on for 10 minutes because at the 10th minute it gave a burning irritating sensation to my cheeks where the edges of the mask were The result on my skin wasnt matte at all Im the Queen of matte skin I dont like having a shiny face but this left my face shiny anyway Ill just continue using charcoal masks because those truly do make your face completely matte , Like the feeling on my skin not sure yet whats the benefits but with my very sensitive skin Im glad it didnt ruin my skin so its a good one for me , The quality of this sheet mask is better than Sephoras other sheet face masks It has a jelly texture instead of the paper feel like the other ones My skin feels good Ive used a lot of the Sephora brand sheet masks and this is the best one Ive used so far , I always buy these sephora sheet masks for using while I relax in my bath tub  I enjoyed this one specifically because it smelled spa like and helps hold in moisture while Im trying to boil myself alive in a jacuzzi tub  It is definitely worth grabbing for a self care relaxation night  I will buy a few more of this specific hemp mask on my next visit in store , The mask felt good but wasnt very moist Felt like it was a little dry when applying"
Clean Lip Balm & Scrub,"If you are looking for soft and smooth lip balm this is not the right product for you The texture is very rough and has no moisture or softness , The grains are way too big and it hurts my lips Not the best , This product is not a good value for the money  it is corse in texture and only sparsely interspersed with the actual exfolient The packaging is flimsy  I have used other scrubs and they are fine and soften your lips much more , I ordered this one because there wasnt any coconut flavour left I really like it Its relatively cheap My only problem with it is that it kinda starts to fall apart when you use it I am not a big fan of the flavour but it , I tried it and the texture and smell was weird Ive tried the other colorother type and they worked good just not the peppermint , the lip balm is not pink more like a white and its very dry with a weird smell to it , Ew this is the worst thing ever makes my lips look so weird and has weird black dots and sugar chunks in it its so disgusting taste and feels like plastic and is so hard to apply 010 , This smells really good I wished it kept my lips moisturized longer though , Dont buy please  Theres a reason why its so cheap Ur lips will turn hard , Its ok not great I have tried other ones that do a better job If your lips arent too dry this will do the job , i love these i got the vanilla one idk why it says i got the coconut one it smells so good i have the matching lip mask thing from the same collection and scent leaves a tiny white cast is also super moisturizing , This does what it says But you have to get past the awful taste   It has a bitter taste vs a sweet vanilla taste  I wont buy this flavor again , I loved this It works great made my lips really soft after being chapped , Keeps my lips moisturized in when the air is dry inside Especially when I get cracks in the corners of my mouth during the winter months Ive never bought anything like this before but will continue to , disappointedcouldnt get rid of the graveldirtlike feeling on my lipsnormally love vanilla anything but this was a bust , Not impressed Be super gentle when using this product you dont want to shred your lips into pieces , The smell is atrocious I love vanilla scented everything but this is straight up gross , alright lip balm kind of a wax like texture not my go to lip balm but it works , Ive tried these in the rose and watermelon variants first and loved BOTH  the rose especially  its very gritty and has a lot of sugar and exfoliant particles so it does a great job if you use it it daily your lips wont get crusty it also smells good and the taste is like wax nothing too bad The watermelon one is good too but it could be a little more hydrating  I top it with a lip balm gloss because on its own its more emollient than hydrating , Smells so good it felt so good on my lips Would definitely recommend 100 , HORRIBLE tints your lips a blue color and irritates lips only buy if you want your lips to shed even more , Love this Great way to exfoliate the lips  smells like birthday cake , I didnt like the product It was very thick and you had to scrub for a while to even get to the exfoliants didnt hydrate my lips , I was really excited to try an exfoliating lip balm especially for so cheap but like many of the reviews I was thrown off by the playdoh smell and the unflattering vanilla colored tint left on my lips However I cant deny that the actual exfoliating process does work , Bon produit pour son prix Fait son travail Le seul problme que jai eu cest que le baume retombe facilement dans ltui alors je dois souvent le ressortir pendant lapplication , this smells like play dough if youre into that It doesnt really do much for my lips I guess they were moisturized , So glad for the markdown price for 350 that I added this to my cart at the end as I was debating Easy application plus flavored vanilla tasting which makes it fun to do What a big lip helper , Really bad  drying painful and CHALKY Instructions say you can leave it on after use  even after wiping it off I still had a GREEN chalky hue on my scabbed lips This is a fail Sephora No No , This was so cute and left my lips feeling very higdrated and not chaped defenetly going to buy again , smells like playdoh and leaves a weird white sludge on lips doesnt work as a lip balm or a scrub , I needed more lip balms and this was on sale and I loveeee vanilla scented things so I decided why not It is a little small it goes on nice But I cant get over the artificial vanilla smell it barely smells like vanilla I tried to keep it but the smell is gross so I will be throwing it away The picture is of the packaging and how much balm you get its all the way rolled up I like to be honest as possible in my reviews someone else might love it though It just wasnt for me , i bought this because it was on sale and cheap but i actually really love the application of this it moisturizes my lips and doesnt cause them to be even more chapped will definitely repurchase , i just received my order today I love the scent and the feel on my lips but it doesnt seem very scrubby i was expecting a more of a sugar scrub texture but its basically a slightly grainy lip balm for the price i think it was a really good product , Its a nice lip balm and has a slight tint when you layer a couple of times However not the most hydrating or exfoliating , smaller then expected but still a good size I LOVED the feeling after the first use  it really felt like a lip exfoliatorlip balm and I LOOVED it now it feels like just a lip exfoliator that leaves your lips moisturized which is still great usually these dry out and then when you try to apply it the sugar comes off everywhere but this one is great Im hoping to try the other ones I just ordered the vanilla one all in all this is a great product and this is my honest review I do wish that it tasted like mint though it smells like mint and every now and then you get a sugar taste from all the sugar that exfoliates your lips the taste kind of reminds me of old beauty oil  if anyone knows what that smells like or like expired facebody oil otherwise its a great product I would say order it , Pretty harsh on your lipsspend the money on a good oneor make your own , its ok but not even close to one of the better lip scrubs ive tried the actual scrub parts in here can be quite harsh to the point where its difficult to use more than one swipe which isnt enough to do any real scrubbing but still too harsh , This is a nice and gentle exfoliater You only feel the scrubbing from the stick when you put it on This product REALLY shines after the exfoliation Its SO creamy and moisturizing The last few months Ive been on a lip binge and whod have thought this inexpensive product would be the best of them all The only thing that really comes close to Laniege , Not what I thought it was going to be Does not do what is it supposed to and leaves a weird and unpleasant feeling , Ive been buying these lip scrubs from Sephora for a long time now and I absolutely love them They help so much with dead skin on the lips and make my lips look big and nice , It took a little while for the exfoliation to begin However you only feel it on the stick and it is more of a very delicate scrub and it didnt do much for me however for a daily maintenance product it would be great , I love this Ive tried a few similar products from different brands and they would completely fall apartbreak off and this was solid It scrubs great but also moisturizers so its not too scratchy if that makes sense The price is excellent too , If I could give 0 stars I would Terrible product no offense Youre way better off with plain vaseline , Hate it Its like cactus on the lips Very rough Hurts when you apply minimum pressure Wont buy again , Balm is very fragile and the scrub is very hard so it hurts the lips Did not see any benefit just wasted my money , It is exfoliating but there is no peppermint smell not even a hint of mint Very disappointing I love mint so I am sad there was not any mint flavor or smell It smells like chemicals and plastic , ehhh pretty nice but very grainy it smells like peppermint but dont eat it , Nice packaging but smell not good like old oil I expected methole smell , Smells very old and does not look as pictured Quality control needs some work , Scent is fine but honestly no tint of color provided , I found this very confusing as I thought I was purchasing a lip balm AND scrub as per the header , I was expecting more as a Sephora product I wont purchase it again , I had the worst chapped lips of my life for two weeks Not even aquafor could save me I decided to try this out and honestly it was just what I needed After using it a few times plus my usual lip moisturizer I have the smoothest lips Ive had in months , Just got it today and it smells terrible like plastic or just very cheap  Isnt pink like the picture more like a sheer nude and I dont see any of the scrubbing beads throughout it  Disappointing , Smells rancid  Tasted rancid How old is thisTossed it , I love this it tints my lips and moisturizes but it can get chalky and waxy I bought this in watermelon and peach and the peach seems a bit smoother than the watermelon I would definitely recommend because it is a good price for the product but if it was a little bit smoother that would be nice I love how it smells , The worst chapstick Its dry It goes on dry it makes your lips feel dry Just dont , I bought this because I randomly saw it while in line purchasing other products and desperately needed a lip balm I was really surprised by how nice it felt The smell is really pleasant as well I also love that the packaging is biodegradable Definitely will be purchasing again , Nice color Overall loved the product but it could sometimes get a little waxy on the lips three out of five stars would buy again , Cute packaging but I found the smell kind of gross The texture is okay but not a lip product Id buy twice , Ive only used this a couple of times I honestly bought it as a cheap add on to get a deal and Im so happy I did It perfectly plumps my lips they look smooth but not unrealistically full It was the product I didnt know I needed , This balm feels and smells great but the packaging kind of sucks When applying the balm it will wind itself back into the tube if youre not super careful If youre applying it with a brush though it would be absolutely excellent While the price point is fine because of the packaging flaw I probably wouldnt recommend this especially not with how many different lip balms there are out there , I absolutely loved this this made me feel so refreshed and I was able to digest my food well  I would definitely recommend adding it to your daily self care routine it keeps you healthy and is worth it , I love this lip balm It is my favorite a little pricy but definitely worth it It has the perfect shade and always saves my lips from being chapped I bought so many of these and this one is my favorite but i also recommend dragonfruitcoconutwatermelon , I was so excited to find an affordable lip scrub in a convenient lip balm form Well I was stupid This is not a good product Whatever they put inside the balm to scrub your lips is painful when rubbed on in the balm format The vanilla flavor is good but it leaves an actual flesh toned color on my lips If I dont wipe my lips after using it then it looks like Ive applied my foundation or concealer over my lips like its 2010 Not a good look , Honestly not a fan dried out my lips Not worth getting Maybe for a little girl as part of a gift as fake makeup but not for adults serves no purpose at all , I think the product lives up to its price the packaging wasnt the best but not bad for 350 The product wasted away faster than anticipated whenever i would put it on the product would be pushed to the side and all of the grains would be harsh against my lips I think that I would have liked the product much better in a tub instead of in a lip balm container Overall not the best but not too bad , Its pretty bad I loved the honey lip scrub but this one is terrible  It got very hard to use after a while because the exfoliate beads bunched at the tip causing it to get too hard to use , Its waxy and not very exfoliating Wouldnt recommend Good packaging though Definitely keep the packaging after its reformulated , Its safe for any skin type  I like the real rose smell but the lipstick holder needs to be stronger , It is so good on my lips my lips were dry but now I am seeing progress , This product is a perfect mini size being only about 2 inches It applies so smoothly and isnt too sticky i purchased the peach balm app shows I got cherry and wont let me change that and it really smells peachy nude pink and I love it  I would love to try aa , Smells so good and the tint is amazing Not only that but the packaging is cute , Ive used this product for years and love it Its the perfect lip balm with just a touch of color , Im gonna be honest this doesnt smell like peaches AT ALL it literally smells horrible i cant even explain it , The product felt super waxy  gross  Then when you turn it up to use it as you press down on your lips it sinks back down  So you have to hold it with 2 hands to apply it  hold the product up  Smh garbage , Dried out my lips so bad Like rubbing candle wax on Horrible formula I see why its half off , Its a good lip balm but its not a scrub Its smells light and has no flavor I was looking forward to the scrub part but it feels like nothing new , I am honestly surprised this has such a low rating In my opinion its not meant to be used as a normal chapstickbalm but instead as more of a lip exfoliator during your nightly routine The fragrance is very lovely and I have noticed a difference in softness Actually love it enough to purchase every color , Does not smell like cherry so dont get your hopes up there BUT I do like the texture and packaging The paper packaging is specialdifferent And I love that I can swipe it on without having to check if its bled out or too much Its a great balm not sticky or watery I just there was better colours A true red or burgundy even Something with colour but natural looking This is almost there but still bright pink on my naturally colourless lips Not bad looking just not a colour I like , Not sure how this is a clean product because it smells incredibly chemical I do like the color and it glides on smoothly but it doesnt last very long and the smell is so bad I dont want to use ititpackaging though , Im currently on accutane which drys out your lips completely and keep searching for a lip balm which helps if even only for 20 minutes This lip balm isnt moisturizing whatsoever It also smells like PlayDog NOT cherry It does have a nice tint to it so if you just need a bit of extra color it does work well for that , I like it ngl It smells nice and it feels nice on my lips The only thing is that its definitely a bit too scratchy and it leaves a white residue on my lips making them look SUPER dry , Wasnt expecting this to be very pigmented rather than that its very good and I absolutely love this , I really like this product its cheap and good and helped for my dry lips to get smoother It stays on my lips for a long time and I love the packaging and the smell of the chapstick , Im so glad I got it on sale It smells like cardboard and feels so thick and icky It also is a gross almost hot pink tint Yikes , I honestly dont know what people expected from this for under 4 But it didnt smell bad taste bad or anything like that It is a decent product for the price My lips arent extremely dry tho if they were I might be disappointed , its so dry it has srub particles and hurts the lips I used dozens of different types of lip balm and have never seen one like this These coarse particles shouldnt even use on our skin how can someone design them to be used on lips , I didnt have high expectations given the other reviews I figured Id risk my 3 This stuff is garbage It does drag as others have stated I feel like I just coated my lips in plastic wax They dont feel hydrated at all , I am overall happy with this lipbalmscrub Its creamy but not too heavy Scented but not very strong Didnt add much color to my lips though  It kept my lips hydrated for a good hour , Never leave the house without this ever since I discovered it dont really get the bad reviews Nice if youre wearing no makeup and want to give your lips a light tint The cherry one is the most tinted the watermelon has minimal tint and the coconut has none , I wouldnt recommend this to anyone I have to force it on my lips and its the worst formula Ive ever seen in a lip balm Very stiff and dry , I bought this product as a why not seeing as I was already making an 100 order and this product was only 350 It has a really nice scent but it wasnt my favorite consistency It wasnt very balmy Overall worth it but not my favorite lip balmscrub , Love this scrub Have reordered it three times After you get about halfway through the stick there are not as many scrubbing crystals but thats fine by me Its still a great lip balm I want to try the coconut but its constantly out of steak , Its definitely not the most amazing coconut scent or texture but if youre in a bind its also not the worst It does smell like play dough and is very waxy dry and tough so try to warm it before use to make that sensation go down , I actually have the cherry but it doesnt update This is really waxy and drags as its going on Id rather have a 150 Chapstixit at least goes on smoothly , I got the cherry My sister has it and I tried it from her loved it Anyone who tried it from me loved it too  best cherry lip balm perfect color The low rating is odd as I am someone whos picky and rarely gives 5 stars , The only thing I like about this is the color and packaging The smell is very waxy and you can hardly smell the cherry scent The taste is gross as well very waxy I wont buy it again , Feels like a dry lipstick with bad plastic smell Horrible , Nasty Seems like the oils went rancid or something Smells off no watermelon scent Doesnt glide onto lips No redeeming qualities whatsoever , Bitter in taste no need to spend your 10 on this there are better option , got the peach balm feels drying immediately after application , il sent bon mais je trouve que la couleur est beaucoup trop pigmente pour un baume  lvre , Definitely worth buying leaves a beautiful pink tint on your lips and leaves them feeling soft and perfect , The best Balm Ive ever used Ive had really gross cracking lips for most of my life because I lick my lips too much like a psycho But I wear this at night slap some Aquaphor on top to lock it in aalperfeafterwards Seriously the bestest ever , I bought this on sale knowing it is a scrub stick Its a little dry so I wet my lips first It is so much easier to use vs the Lush scrub I had My lips are still smooth 24 hours later I rinse it off just as I did the Lushthan the , I bought several of these balms and I am thoroughly disappointed   The balms are not the least bit moisturizing  In fact the product itself is very dry  Smells like a waxy crayon as well  Awful , I dont understand the bad reviews I bought this thinking it was a lip scrub but it turned out to be pretty decent lip balm for three bucks Ive had huda and other fancy lip balms which were utterly useless and didnt do anything to help chapped lips but this worked It smelled nice too All considered Id buy it again , Really do not recommend this product Not at all moisturizing the coconut smells and tastes like plastic and makes my lips feel more dry , Absolutely useless The rose is a scrub that might as well be a chapstick So if the peppermint Dont buy these , This stuff was garbage and did not leave my lips feeling any better , Honestly the coconut lip balm is pretty decent Ingredients are not bad and it does the job All the other flavors are a HARD PASS just look at the nasty ingredients literally plastic polyethylene is an ingredient Seeing how we actually ingest a fair amount of lip products by virtue of them going on our actual mouths its worth being a bit careful So all those are a big fat no but the coconut is alright , I was skeptical at first because of the reviews Dont let it dissuade you This lip scrub is AWESOME I got the rose I loved it so much I just ordered another rose and a vanilla to try Im reaching for this a dozen times a day Leaves your lips so smooth and just the right amount of balm residue For the ones writing bad reviews they must be expecting Guerlain Sephora products are excellent at the price point , Smells more like playdoh than vanilla and the scrubbing aspect is nonexistent This could be free and it still wouldnt be worth it , The formula isnt that bad people complaining are probably used to fake Vaseline and Carmex lip balms The Cherry balm has great color and feels comfortable on the lips Feels like beeswax almost very natural  much better for your lips , Extremely harsh as far as the scrubbing part and oddly has as much pigment as some lipsticks which doesnt make any sense since you technically have to wipe it off after scrubbing your lips Also smells like lipstick did in the 90s No bueno , For the price its not bad Gives a nice tint It has very cute packaging Does not keep lips hydrated , I guess this is OK for the sale price The tints are nice and I actually really loved the scent of this and also the cherry one but it lasted for about 10 minutes For a lip balm I expected it to have somewhat lasting moisture for mildly chapped lips Packaging is cute but not functional to be thrown around in your bag or car its like cardboardy and feels like it could easily be ruined , This product is so affordable it is only 7 And it has just a hint of color It comes in sustainable packaging and the product itself smells so good I would recommend this for the everyday woman , It smelled awful and like playdoh It did nothing for my lips either , I love this lip balm I have bought it at least 15 times over the years It is the perfect level of hydration has no gross aftertaste is not gloppy and has a very light scent that I find pleasant and I am sensitive to strong scents I put it on generously on my lips right before bed after I wash all my makeup off for the evening  It has cured my chapped lips in the winter I use this lip balm every night all year long including in the warmer months  It goes on smooth and also doesnt melt or break the way the Fresh lip balms do Perfection in a little tube , Skip this one I got this because it was on discount I did not like it at all Didnt do anything for my lips , No mentioned instructions Makes no difference It has a glue stick texture , The smell threw me off more than anything I wanted to love this because Sephora is amazing but I couldnt get beside the smell , I used to love this stuff Now it smells like play dough and wont even go on The texture is awful I will never buy this again , I didnt mind it Use it everyday Like a normal chapstick , I love Sephora and have used a number of Sephora Collection products including lip balms I hoped to like this one but unfortunately just didnt The color was subtle and pretty but it smelled like a crayon and wasnt as moisturizing as other SC lip products Wont be repeating this purchase , The color is very pink its cherry I wanted at least a darker pink or red tint  and super smooth not exfoliating at all Too expensive for a product thats just not worth it  , Its an okay lip balm It has a bit of an odd cardboard scent to it , very weird consistency for a lip scrub feels very thick and pasty and very little exfoliating properties to it barely any scrub particles hard to wipe off and lips felt no different after using , The LEAST lovely lip balm ever made Yuck Smells really nice Feels AWFUL , I love this balm Keeps those lips looking soft n fresh all year long , THE COLOR Omg it looks so good I love it sm and bought it hundreds of times , If I could leave zero stars for this I would Bought this chapstick about a year ago and was SO in love with its coconuty scent and moisturizing effect It almost was like using coconut oil on my lips but in chapstick form Well I recently ran out so I went to purchase another and the new formula is HORRIBLE It tastes and smells like playdocrayons It is AWFUL and Im quite sad about it to be honest This product was by far my favorite chapstick Ive ever owned It gave me tropical vacation vibes and it is really disappointing that such an amazing product doesnt exist anymore , Amazing 5 stars  Smells Soo good  Definitely going back to buy more , I never write reviews so listen to me when I say this is the worst lip balm youll ever try Lips immediately feel like they have chalk on them when applicators and the taste is awful Went to shoppers and found a better one for half the price , Does the job smells like very cheap candle wax not at all what I was hoping for , I was in the market for a new lip scrub and really excited to try this product because of its reasonable price Unfortunately the coconut one both tasted and smelled like PlayDoh , If I could give this 0 stars I would Dont waste the 7 on this one Bad packaging bad smell bad tint doesnt hydrate my lips and slips down into the tube with the slightest bit of pressure Just dont do it youve been warned , I keep one of these with me everywhere as its a soothing scrub that keeps my lips nice and moisturized , Great price for the size it lasts me forever its my second one the colour is super cute and natural perfect for a clean girl look feels great on the lips and hydrates , Nothing about this is a scrub Going right back n will jus get the fresh brand , I LOVE this scrub its works so well and smells amazing , has a very nice pigment to it where it shows but isnt overpowering a bit of a weird texture with the scrub in it but overall really well for its price , Good doesnt smell a lot but I recommend it its very practical and I like that the packaging its good for the earth , Can I just saw ugh   So waxy  And hard  And you better like coconut cause it never leaves you The scent  There is no moisture that you get from it  My lips feel worse off after its use , I got this in a Sephora favorites lip pack sampler  To be fair I didnt buy the pack for this but I was happy that this was included because I like the sephoras in house product line sometimes   My plan for this balm was Id hoped itd be a nice balm to put on my lips while applying my makeup in the morning So I wasnt expecting much just something to hydrate and wipe off before putting on lipstick This will not work for that nor will it work as a lip balm throughout the dayfor me The balm bullet I got is one of the waxiest and hard lip products Ive tried in a very long time  There is no creaminess or softness to be had with what I got  Also the taste is a plastic coconut taste that even when wiped off remains  I disliked this so much Ive thrown it away , I bought this product a year ago and I liked it My new one goes on blotchy and weird it also has way more pigment than the last one Doesnt stay in place Absolutely not moisturizing  Very disappointing that it was changed Ill never buy again , Pick up for myself while my daughter was shopping  My lips felt parched and I had switched bags so my usual lip balm was home I thought it was a Sephora product must be good and worth the price tag Boy was I wrong  First it had a tint which I didnt realize Made me look like I was wearing a cheap play makeup I maybe worn when I was 7 I hoped it would quench WRONG Did the opposite went on like a crayon Dry Dragged across my lips A hint of Watermelon mostly a scent  again not the fruity quench I had hoped  SO DISAPPOINTED I wanted to March right back to the store and return it but unfortunately we had a time crunch In an effort to give it a second chance I had it in my car and used it running errands say twice  still hated it AND it CHAPPED MY LIPS Going in the trash  Dont waste your money  Shame on you Sephora  Shame on you Sticking with my Burts Bees Pomegranate , I was expecting watermelon smell or taste and nothing Just a lip balm in an environmentally friendly cardboard packaging I wont cry if I lose it and definitely wont recommend or buy again , Really dry and waxy the colour comes off blotchy on your lips Feels like a crayon , Not sure why this was reformulated This used to be a lovely mild coconut scented semi glossy lip balm Now its gross , This is likelip smackers for adults Doesnt smell very good cute packaging doesnt hydrate your lips at all Soooooya definitely a pass on this one , I love this lip balm Very cheap for what you are getting I have bought some in the past and they last me forever They are also very smooth on the lip and make your lips look beautiful and glossy for a long time For a lip balm it is much more like a gloss in the fact that it makes your lips very shiny and nice Overall I love the product and would 1010 recommend for male and female , It did not scrub to remove the dead skin I applied three times and it still did not work , Yuck Feels like the cheap play lipstick I used when I was a kid Has next to no scent Plain sugar and Vaseline will be an upgrade from this garbage Wouldnt use it if it were free Zero stars , I was pleasantly surprised with this It really does the job It feels good on lasts a long time smells and tastes good and you cant beat the price Highly recommend , This product in 2022 is NOTHING LIKE it was in previous years It is totally different color smell texture it applies horribly , Dry and hard to apply to lips Flavor is way off too , The watermelon lip balm is really quite lovely I purchase again and again , I read a review that said it felt like rubbing glass shards against your lips I do not disagree with that statement That said I used the entire tube of it , They changed it and not for the bet"
Clean Peeling Mask,"The only mask that leaves my skin squeaky clean and with a subtle glow Plus I love the smell I wish it didnt sell out all the time and that they stopped carrying them in the store Has the best scores but removed from stores Book , I typically dont expect sheet masks to do anything more than smell nice and make you feel like youre taking care of yourself but this one seemed to actually do something When you put this on its extremely tingly bordering on stingy so I couldnt wear it for the full 3 minutes It kinda feels like when you eat too much pineapple but on your faceAfterwards your face is extremely shiny like youve polished off all the dead skin , This face mask gave me a horrible rash that made my whole face red I have very sensitive skin If you have a skin type similar to mine definitely do not buy , The name of this mask is slightly misleading My skin never peels from it rather it looks so radiant and feels so smooth I love doing this the morning of a big event to give me an extra glow Highly recommend , This feels like a thicker cloth mask that fits my face well and the holes for the eyes werent too small It uses a yellow serum that has a light fresh fruity scent berry and citrus is cooling and hydrating and does give a glow effect due to the yellow dye Mask is soaked in serum but not much serum left over in pack Its not tacky feeling but has a slip Directions recommend using 2x a week and I left it on for about 10 minutes and it didnt dry up I dont see any ingredients that could provide exfoliation though but it contains niacinamide , I purchased this mask after seeing the rave reviews I followed the instructions and I am still waiting to see what the hype is about Other than an amazing scent I felt no real difference in my skin , I was skeptical about a Sephora sheet mask but I actually loved this one My skin felt great afterwards but my only complaint was the bright yellow dye in the mask that stains your skin and fingers if kept on for any longer than 6 minutes Worth it for the way my skin felt afterwards though , This is a great mask Especially for the value I didnt notice anything glow glowing as it says but it was a yellow mask and smelt kinda like lemon so I guess thats why it is a glowing type of a mask Felt like a regular mask nothing special But is nice for the price , Got this facemask for my boyfriend and i must say it worked soo well for him I exfoliated and washed his face before putting this on and it cleared his pores so well and brightened up his very red sensitive skin Will repurchase for him again  , Its very exfoliating and left my skin feeling fresh and clean , Honestly the best Sephora mask Ive tried all of them and the rest are just ok  you can get better masks at the same or lower price points from Korean brands This mask tho is amazing and it works great at what it promises to do , I recieved this mask along with others in a gratis package for my honest reviews  this is a nice hydrating sheet mask even though its a short mask time it has some good hydrating glowy qualities that I was amazed by how nice my skin looked afterward Ive been steering away from sheet masks for a while but its a nice treat every now and again , Didnt leave my skin feeling gross It gave me a nice glow , I LOVED this mask The word peeling scared me But when I was at my local Sephora yesterday a Beauty Advisor told me that its just a name thats used that it exfoliates off the top layer of skin which reveals the fresh skin underneath Its supposed to brighten and soften your skin I love that Sephora is replacing the old formula with this CLEAN version It shows that they care about what we put on our skin The mask really does smell like fruit Mostly lemons and a slight blueberry smell Turns out blueberries is in the ingredients The mask gives a tingly sort of burning sensation I was okay with it Theres citrus in it so I was understanding and it wasnt uncomfortable Its recommended for 3 minutes anyway I have oily acne prone skin and this made my face a shade lighter I saw a difference from my face and shoulder skin tone Also my skin became very smooth and soft This mask was an inexpensive treat , I was skeptical that a three minute mask would do anything but I absolutely noticed softer skin after one use Will purchase again , I really liked this mask I only had one so this review is only based off of one time use Its very gentle and didnt dry out my skin It has a light nonoverwhelming freshcitrus scent was really refreshing I was a bit apprehensive that it would do anything in only three minutes but I did notice my skin looked a bit brighter afterwards I cant say much to the overall effects regarding longterm glow improving uneven texture and minimizing pores but I definitely would like to give these a try longterm , I received this mask in a gratis package from Sephora to try out in exchange for my honest review This is a fibre sheet mask with an invigorating citrus scent Due to being a peeling mask it is recommended to wear for only 3 minutes This was tough because this mask felt so incredible on Wonderfully cool and slightly tingling I honestly did not want to take it off I tried this mask out in the evening so after removing it I washed my face as recommended applied moisturizer and went to bed I really noticed the difference the next morning My complexion looked bright and glowing I definitely recommend this product , This was a nice mask I was slightly concerned about the lemon in it being drying and getting more oily after the fact but that didnt end up being the case Skin felt nice after , this feels nice I dont use very many glowy products I feel it highlights my texture my skin felt smooth , Niacinamide is one of the top ingredients so you can expect some help with minimizing enlarged pores improving uneven skin tone softening fine lines and wrinkles brightening diminishing dullness Might help regulate sebum production also The fruits acids will provide some gentle exfoliation hence peeling Its affordable and its made with clean ingredients If these properties appeal to you try it , I really liked this mask Firstly it smells delicious I kept it on for about 5 minutes then I rinsed it off It made my skin feel fresh moisturized and dewy It was a nice little treat and my 2 year old son got a kick from how crazy mommy looked  He was disappointed when it was time to take it off Overall  I would definitely use this again for a little at home spa day , For the price I would say this sheet mask was good I wouldnt recommend using this if your skin is sensitive if you have any recently popped pimples andor open wounds because it will burn Did make my skin feel fresh and clean May repurchase because of cheap price"
Clean Skin Gel Cleanser with Prebiotics,"Meh Nothing great about this cleanser Does the job but pretty forgettable , After using product my skin become too dry and its peeling really bad experience , Ive been using this cleanser for several months now its a super gentle foaming gel cleanser I love that it doesnt have scent and I feel like it does a fantastic job cleansing my skin for the price point its perfect occasionally if Ive worn a lot of makeup that day I will double cleanse or I will start with a makeup melting balm , Ive been using this product for the past several months and it is by far the best cleanser Ive used I have sensitive skin so Im overly cautious with particular skin products and luckily its been working Currently reordering this product , The consistency of this was interesting I didnt feel like it cleansed my face well I also think it broke me out even though its noncomedogenic I ended up returning it because I dont think its worth it even at that price point , Is this life changing No but its the best affordable cleanser Ive used and Ive tried a lot including all Cerave and Neutrogena ones My skin feels nice and clean without the stripping feeling , Ive been trying to find a nonfoaming morning cleanser trying from Avene CeraVe Neutrogena and LaRoche but all made me break out or made my skin dry This cleanser has minimal ingredients and cleans without drying my skin The packaging is okay and have to be careful that not too much product comes out  but for the price this product is still great quality I think its a great dupe for the Drunk Elephant Beste cleanser which I prefer to use evenings or when I feel like I have more cleansing needed , My favorite face wash Its great at removing makeup and doesnt irritate my sensitive skin My face feels so clean after My boyfriend even loves using it too , not a good cleanser at all The consistency the way the gel foams the over powering smell are all awful I dont feel clean after I use this , I really like this cleanser It is very very gentle and left my skin in great condition I will buy again , I recently finished a tube of this stuff and am using up another in the meantime and honestly I cant wait to go back to this one The texture is so pleasant and it leaves my skin so soft and bouncy that in an emergency I can actually use it and then leave the house without moisturizer I suspect thats due to the inulin which is a polysaccharide and therefore great at holding on to moistureIt is not technically malasseziafungal acne safe due to the cocoglucosides which contain fatty alcohols but it hasnt bothered my fungal acne at all since its in contact with it for such a short time In fact after months of using this I think my acne bumps are far fewer and less noticeable and my skin overall looks smoother and brighterBonus its actually really good for cleaning in and around the ears  it melts wax and removes buildup around healed piercings like a dream , I bought this on a whim but it has quickly become one of my dave cleansers I have sensitive acne prone combo skin and a lotttt of facewashes irritate me or break me out but this one is great and affordable , I really love this cleanser Its very gentle and has good ingredients I make sure to always have one at home and when traveling  I highly recommended , I really wanted to like this product after reading all the reviews but I feel like it doesnt do a great job I use it as a second cleanser now when I double cleanse but own its own it just doesnt leave me feeling super clean Its definitely light and I like that its fragrance free but it doesnt lather up  seem to be doing not a lot for the cleaning , Enjoy the daily use its quite gentle which is what I need It is a bit easy to accidentally pour too much onto the hand tho would be good if it was more controlled , Its incredible Leaves my skin super soft and glowy I love it , After using this product for more than a year I am hooked I cannot buy anything else My acne is cleared up my skin is soft and glows I highly recommend , love this stuff so much makes my skin feel so soft and always calms down my irritated skin definitely recommend , I purchased this item because of the great reviews but This cleanser did not work for me It did not remove my makeup after 2 washes as my usual cleansers would and it doesnt wash off easily I wont be repurchasing its a No for me , Great product great price Its going to replace my Fresh soy face cleanser since the latter is expensive and the smells bothers me This Sephora cleanser removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped of all moisture It has a light smell that must be inherent to the ingredients but isnt fragranced Very happy with this new staple product in my skincare routine , I love Sephoras gel cleansers that are for face neck and eyes With sensitive eyes cleaning them daily is very important and have it integrated into my daily face cleanser makes my life so much easier It is gentle but does the job well , An excellent product which I didnt expect and I will no longer buy the high end products  The cleanser removes all your makeup including waterproof mascara and eyeliner and leaving your skin soft and clean  Cant wait to try other products from Sephora , After using this cleanser for two weeks it has been a great addition to my skincare routine It leaves my skin soft hydrated and clean It does It strip your skin at all  perfect gel cleanser I received my first bottle as a sample and just purchased a new bottle , Wow   Jai jamais aussi ressentie mon visage aussi propre , I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Drunk Elephant cleanser but this is not it Feels like Im trying to wash my face with aloe vera gel and does not remove makeup nearly as well , I have super sensitive skin that does get oily and this cleanser is really great to use morning or evening It contains probiotics which is calming to my skin in particular Costeffective  fragrance free which is great Only thing I kind of wish is that it lathers a tad bit more But I do love it Good find Would re purchase and recommend  , i used twice a day morning and evening for about a week and my face got considerably dry to the point where it was cracking , I have dry skin and wanted a cleanser which still foams but doesnt leave my skin dry with simple ingredients as welland this is that product It feel so nice on the skin , I would never recommend this product It doesnt do anything for the skin and caused MAJOR break outs Do not recommend , I have somewhat oily skin I dont where much makeup  I was looking for a alternative to orgins zero gel cleanser they discontinued I did not like this at all it has a lube feeling and does not get face fully clean have to dash m , This may be a different opinion compared to the many others who have bought this face wash but I didnt love it I have repurchased it twice because it is a good simple face wash for sensitive skin but after using other face washes I dont like how this one washes my skin It doesnt lather much and doesnt give me that clean feeling that i love after ive washed my face It has a slimey texture but honestly the product does what it needs to do and works well I just have other face cleansers that I prefer more , My sister had this in her bathroom and I tried it and loved it  It did not make my skin feel tight or dry and I will be buying it for myself as soon as I am done with her purloined tube , I absolutely love this stuff I have dry sensitive skin and I have had trouble with many cleansers in the past I have struggled with severe eczema ever since I was a baby so skin care has been a struggle for me my entire life Once I tried this cleanser I cant imagine myself switching to anything else Its hydrating gentle on the skin and great for anyone looking to save a penny or two To all of my sensitiveskin girlies out there I highly recommend this , This is a great cleanser with simple ingredients and I can use it with other actives which is great , I have the original product with amino acids  but after doing a quick view of the ingredients I noticed there isnt much difference to the formulation other than the removal of the scent  This was my staple face wash for at least three years but unfortunately its become clear that this is designed for one skin type  This face wash is what Id recommend to anyone with oily combination or oily skin  as that was my skin type a few years ago while I was still going thru puberty  For anyone with drier combination skin  this will DESTROY your skin barrier  I use summer fridays jet lag as my facial moisturizer because this wash now strips my skin of all moisture  It  alongside niacinamide  cleared up my acne beautifully and was a perfect face wash until my skin type changed  , My favorite cleanser I have normal to dry skin No need to spend 30 for a cleanser this one has everything I need and I love how it smells , This became an instant staple for my daily cleansing routine  I have sensitive eyes and live in an arid climate making dry skin a constant battle  This gel cleanser is really gentle fragrancefreeneutral and works well to deep clean your skin without stripping it down to nothing Although gentle it removes waterproof eyebrow makeup and lip stains too , Waited almost two weeks to review just to be sure but this is the best cleanser Ive used My skin was angry and this has repaired my skin barrier so much Im really impressed Way better than products Ive used that were 3x the price , Light and gentle on your skin Affordable  great for daily use , Ive had all kinds of cleansers this ones my favorite , I am fairly new to skincare and have been loving the way this makes my skin feel Ive been using it on my face and neck and my skin looks soooo nice I would highly recommend it , I bought this because it was reasonably priced and the Sephora employee recommended it I was too lazy to try and find anything else Im glad I did end up buying this It has a very nice jelly texture cleanses the skin perfectly did not feel like it stripped my skin and made my skin feel refreshed without the squeaky clean feel I know should be avoided The ingredients also seem to be quite good It did help with my active breakouts my skin was instantly less inflamed and the size of my pimples had reduced I now use it as a body wash as well because it just feels so good I will be buying it again and again , I love this product its really a game changer in one use of trying this all my pimples were gone or had shrunken but after using it  it did make my face a little red for a bit , I am super sensitive to most cleansers but this one is perfect , I dont typically use facial cleansers sense they tend to irritate my skin Ive used baby in scented soap for years I wanted something a little stronger to clear up these enlarged pores that have come with my thirties and I love it , tried this as a dupe for the  fresh soy cleanser but unfortunately it did not measure up it is a nice face wash as a 2nd cleanser the smell is very plasticky though , To set the scene I have combination skin that gets oily on my Tzone and cheeks with my jawline and upper lip being more dry I am also currently on a prescription grade Tretinoin 005 I first got this product as I was told would be a very basic and gentle cleanser Upon first use I love how it was fragrance free a gel texture and cleansed my sling and removed my sunscreen well However after using the product consistently morning and night for a week along side my tretinoin it was a tad too much for me I experienced an over drying effect all over and a breakout on my forehead I think this is It also burned my eyes if I got them in there I think this would be a great product for those who have a bit more oily skin or are not on a prescription grade retinols like tretinoin Is it a bad product  No Was it right for me my skin and my routine Also no , Really good gentle cleanser Its fragrance free and has a gelaloe texture It doesnt get sudsy when mixed with water making it really gentle on the skin I have really sensitive and reactive skin and I havent had any issues with this and Im not typically big on cleansers , Amazing I will be honest I was slightly sceptical because it was by Sephora and not a trendy brand but oh my god does it clean well my pores I washed my face three times and my skin looks like I got a facial done Absolute miracle worker I cant believe its only 16 must try , Its ok I have super sensitive combination skin It works ok but the gel is so thick that it takes forever to wash off and it felt like it didnt cleanse my oiler spots very well , This product is ok  Didnt cause breakout or no strong perfume But what I dont understand is why Sephora has to change its most basic product basic cleaner  The original cleaner worked better cleansed better smelled better  It was 99 natural ingredients  Now they also raised the price not 10 but more than 30 for a cleaner Its so annoying , This is so gentle on the skin and easy on the eyes my 10 year old daughter uses it if she needs to wash off dirt andor sunscreen from her face I tried giving her a few other common drugstore brands Cerave Cetaphil and she complained they all stung her eyes as shes just learning to wash her face properly lol This one she doesnt complain about and the price is right for a kid who might also waste a bit of product from time to time , I have very dry skin This cleanser is non drying and a little goes a long way Very happy with this purchase , This is a clear thin gel thats thin but not so thin it doesnt stay on your hands There is a real slip to this it doesnt feel oily at all but it goes over your skin with the ease of an oil or serum I absolutely love it it feels so gentle there is no fragrance dont let that gentle feel fool you this removes even waterproof liner and mascara with ease This doesnt sting or create a film on my eyes like some balm makeup removers can it rinses everything away easily You only need to use a small amount and after rinsing skin feels so hydrated its almost as though you have already applied moisturizer This has replaced my Clinique Take The Day Off and its affordable so its in every bathroom for the whole family , I got this for my daughter and she really liked how light it felt on her face would definitely recommend , A decent daily gel cleanser I dont find it to be any better than anything else though Gentle on sensitive skin but Im not noticing any lessening of redness or less zits or smoother skin , Officially my one and only go to cleanertoner For sensitive flaky skin , I will be repurchasing this cleanser It is gentle on my skin and has helped keep my skin clear My teenage son has been enjoying it aswell It says it is scent free but I do find it has a mild clean scent to it that I enjoy The price point is great I hope that Sephora keeps making this one , Get this It has the best texture and is totally safe for the eyes I use it with the goldfaden needless solution and it gives glass skin SERIOUSLY BUY THIS , I dont know about the prebiotic part but this is a nice gel cleanser with no fragrance and doesnt irritate my skin You should consider the sephora collection before shelling out big bucks for over hyped cleansers , My skin is very sensitive and dry This feels nice but it broke me out terribly , Gentle nononsense cleanser that has kept oil and flakes at bay on this sensitive skin  It doesnt break the bank eitherMy only complaint is minor because its fragrancefree the natural scent is not great  I would rather it remain fragrancefree for people with fragrance sensitivities , I use this as my daily cleanser and it works great I have never had a cleanser that didnt make my skin purge especially after work outs I am very pleased and would recommend it to anyone else that has dry skin with occasional breakouts , A gentle fragrance free cleanser that doesnt upset my skin or cause further acne despite my skin being extremely sensitive Can be a tad drying when my face is irritated from retinol but doesnt make the irritation any worse This is the first cleanser Ill completely finish and repurchase The price cannot be beat , This is such a good cleanser Absolutely love it I got aging near 40 yo mix greasy and dry sensitive skin No perfume at all the smell is the actual product smell without camouflage so yeah its not a fruityfloral smell as the industry makes us think its good no surprise here and no perfume is perfect for my kind of skin Have had no breakouts since I started using it and its kind of a miracle really Si happy to have found my cleanser at this price Way to go Sephora Thanks a lot , best cleanser ever please dont ever discontinue , This is a really gentle cleanser and is super kind to your skin if youre into a exfoliating or retinoid routine I love it and does not irritate my skin whatsoever Such a good value The texture is a little slimey but it makes no difference Just an observation , Love this face wash Very gentle and good for dry skin , A gentle cleanser for daily cleanse Does not get rid of makeup , I normally used a Cerave or Cetaphil cleanser however these had an awful smell and felt very gel like when washing off My girlfriend suggested

without drying Price is right , I love this cleanser I have extremely sensitive skin and I am blown away but how gentle it is My skin felt so good after just one use already Definitely my new favourite cleanser , I wanted to try out a new gentle cleanser to substitute my cerave cleanser while Im travelling so I decided to give this a try Pros it didnt dry out my skin or cause any irritation Cons definitely DOES smell like a strong bathroom cleaner and doesnt lather well Overall I was a bit uncomfortable with putting this on my face due to that strong chemical scent and probably wouldnt use it again , I have tried high end and in between cleansers for my hypersensitive skin My skin reacts if the wind blows in the right direction Skin care can be overwhelming and disappointing when bad reactions occur IN my case redness burning hives and breakouts along with dryness that feels like crusty glue This cleanser has not contributed to any issues The price point is exceptional and zero fragrance that I can detect My skin feels clean not stripped yet supple Please dont change a good thing I plan on stocking up , Best thing I ever I will never go without this product now has made such a difference , I havent been able to use this product regularly enough to see how it works for me because the scent is so overwhelming and gross It smells strongly like bathroom cleaner and totally turns me off of using it on my face I may continue to use it every so often I liked how my face felt after using it but the smell means it definitely isnt an everyday cleanser for me , Very nice cooling gel cleanser Suds up with addedwater and sonic facial brush Skin feels moisturizednot dry and taut after use , You want your skin still hydrated after a good cleanse This is the cleanser for youTo begin the formula of this cleanser feels so cooling and gentle on the skin A little goes a long way with this product so no need to use a ton on your faceWith someone with combination I was worried about simultaneously drying out the dry patches on my skin or making the more oily parts of my face even greasierSpoiler alert neither one happenedIf anything my skin feels softer and more hydrated after using it I highly recommend applying some hyaluronic acid to your skin after using this cleanser to really seal in all of the hydration thats left afterwardsBonus points for getting my difficult mascara off fairly easily too , I would say after trying so many expensive cleansers This one has actually helped me and I could clearly see the difference Not only this I am personally using this cleanser pharmacy toner ordinarys serum in my skin care they have did wonders on my skin , OMG I am a dark skinned woman with oily skin THIS HAS WORKED WONDERS Make sure to follow up with a good moisturizer to help you seal in the moisture This has made my skin so beautiful Thank you sephora , Quality doesnt have to be expensive This Sephora cleanser is very affordable and does its job really well Also it is a part of Vegan and Clean line at Sephora which makes me more confident in using it Overall a very good product especially for its price It is suitable for any skin type and Im satisfied how it works for daily cleansing Its lid is sealed to make sure no one ever opened or used the product which adds some security to it , I love clean simple ingredients but I wasnt impressed by this I have oily skin and love a good gel cleanser but this left my skin flaky and dull looking Positives were fragrance free clean great price point and contains prebiotics Only Negative was a bit too stripping I recommend using a moisturizer or HA serum after every use , Ive used this for two days and my skin is glowing already and face washes have never done that to my skin also I remember I saw this face wash in my ex bsf bathroom one time it was her older sisters and her older sisters hair is literally glowing bro , I couldnt find the ama cleanser from sephora by itself after using it in a set so I went with this one Most cleansers irritate my skin and leave me to wash my face with water This cleanser made me feel so clean it wasnt stripping at all I would even say it moisturized and its unscented Its my favourite , This product is very soft and smooth feeling on the skin The texture of this product is so nice and lathers up

little thicker and i didnt see much of a change on my skin but it works as a great cleanser to take of my make up It feels a little tight on my skin after i use so i feel like i need to use extra

Clean Watermelon After Sun Mask,"Stays on your face well so you can watch Tv or read for the 15 minutes Love that it came with a dcollet which is for your chest Had no idea lol , 3 stars because I dont know how my skin will feel when Im done Came with a piece to put on your chest which I thought was cool and unexpected But it does not stay on your face Has a weird texture compared to other sephora masks and it wont lay over my face it comes up in some parts and keeps sliding off Expect to lay down on your back if you want it to stay on your face , LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this after sun mask  It works so well I stocked up for trips  summer time Definitely get this if you havent tried it , Really impressed by this I finally used this today after I spent too long in the sun yesterday and got a bright red burn on my face and chest It felt super cooling helped with the pain and it honestly made my face and chest significantly less red in colour too  I used the extra liquid in the pack to massage into my shoulders and burnt knees as well Very hydrating , This exceeded expectations For someone whop doesnt love a fake watermelon smell this smelt really good I got very burnt and after using the mask I was extremely less red and more tan the next morning Fav part is the chest piece  so amazing , Love these SO hydrating I have dry skin and Ive been beaching all summer long and doesnt break me out afterwards It smells great works well with dry skin I do genuinely think it helped me stave off a mild sunburn once I started putting these in my bag for every vacation and as gifts for my friends  I def recommend especially for the price point , My favorite Sephora maskI use it after a day at the beach or after a long exposure , I burn super quickly so in the summer this mask was very helpful It soothes the burn and just feels great Make sure to take off the outer linings of the masks to reveal the jelly sheets before applying , Product is amazing after a long day on the water TipTrick put mask in the refrigerator prior to opening for an hour or two then apply Literally such an amazing product for sunburnt skin Price is VERY affordable also , The way the cellulose clings and cools is amazing There is a stiff removable layer on both sides of each of the masks included Make sure you remove both of those to reveal the amazing cellulose layer that clings like a second skin I love that there is a chest piece too , I had an awful sunburn this past week so I grabbed this because it had great reviews and it was only 5 I have to say Im really glad I bought it This Watermelon Mask was super refreshing It has two parts to it one for your face and one for your dcollet Each sheet mask has 2 rough protective layers to it on both sides so be sure to carefully remove those as you apply it The texture of this mask is unlike other sheet masks Ive used its thin but it has somewhat of a jelly texture to it The scent is subtly watermelon not overly sweet or artificial I left this mask on for roughly 20 minutes and then removed the sheets massaging the excess serum into my skin I noticed my sunburn stopped peeling after using this mask and my skin felt less angry and itchy This was a pleasant experience and I am so happy this Sephora product brought me some relief Would buy again , I have tried a lot of masks and this is by far the worse one ive ever tried Quality sucks  and i didnt even notice the mask comes a part for the neck The mask is made with a really rough quality and the part for the face it doesnt even stay on the faceDont waste your money pay more buy something better that you would enjoy , I got this mask from a friend for my birthday and I love it The mask is jellylike and sticks on so nicely  Out of the package it is sandwiched between two rigid papers that you have to peel off It smells so good and it feels cooling Ive never done a mask for my decoulate and it is so relaxing  Game changer Will definitely buy more to keep in the fridge , Let me tell you after a long day in the sun my skin drank up all the moisturizing and skin soothing properties this mask has to offer I used it 3x during my vacation straight out of the fridge and it was so soothing after being in the sun all day The best part Not only does it come with a face mask but also one for your dcolletage Highly recommend and I will definitely be repurchasing for more future days in the sun , The mask does its function of moisturizing the liquid feels good on the face and brings a paper face for its application and a heartshaped one for the dcollet area The material of the pieces of paper is very bad it is rigid plastic and makes it very difficult to keep it in your face For the price it should be of better quality lighter and better adhesion Ive had other sheet masks like Dr Jart that the face to apply is similar to a light  fabric with an excellent application , The best sheet mask from Sephora Collection I usually tan easy but when Ive forgotten to reapply sunscreen and unfortunately burn this is the best to have on hand to put on after getting out of the shower Each time Ive taken the chest part off its been bone dry because my skin has absorbed it all so its definitely have helped in putting off peeling and doesnt make putting makeup on after a day out in the sun feel like a miserable chore Pro tip  keep in the fridge for some extra relief , purchased a few of these for winter beach vacations of course I left them home THE LAST TIME ILL DO THAT purchasing them and packing them in my vacation bag so I wont ever do that again , The Good This is handsdown my favorite face mask created by Sephora Collection by a long shot and I used to quite enjoy the SC sheet masks that are seemingly now discontinued so this is a big compliment Id trade all of those discontinued old masks for this one mask any day I dont even know howwhy I first got my hands on one of these but I remember packing a couple of these to my tropical 10day vacation and BOY were they a god send I burn very easily in intense sun even when I applyreapply sunscreen Having red hottothetouch skin after a day out in the sun has always been the norm for me During my vacation I decided this was the perfect time to use one of these and oh my god was it an instant relief Not only that the redness subsided instantly and it stopped my face from turning into that 2nd day sunburn that everyone knows and hates This mask is not your typical sheet mask its not a sheet mask at all since there is no materialsheet to it its more of the texture of those cellinfused jellylike masks Theres also a chest mask which is super handy because thats another major problem area for getting sun damage These have been my goto for any kind of travel or sun activity for at least 34 years Most recently I used it in July after being in 107 degree Las Vegas weather during the hottest parts of the day and it also helped add some moisture back to my skin that was sucked out by the desert heat on top of subduing my painredness The Bad The jellylike texture mask can be tricky to put onnavigate your first time around Its much more delicate than a sheet mask and can ripstick to itself if not handled with gentle care The Ugly If this mask also gets discontinued I will hold a protest at my local Sephora with picket signs and everything You have been warned Sephora dont you even think about it P , a product yet to try but instantly liked the collar piece just makes it instantly different from other skin products looked In Sephora , I brought this mask with me on a trip to Mexico and used it after a full day in the sun It instantly cooled my warm skin and I felt very refreshed I personally rinsed the residue off after removing the mask but you dont need to Im glad Sephora includes a mask for your chest as well since that area gets a lot of sun too , Ive had this mask stashed away for a while but finally got around to using it after a long day out in the sun It felt amazing as soon as I put it on my face Really helped with rehydration and soothing my face and neck I love how cooling it was , this is my favorite mask to use after an accidental face sunburn im usually really good about reapplying sunscreen when im out in the sun but this mask always help with rehydration , You know when youre traveling how hard it is to keep up a skin routine that changes to fit your needs without brining an extra carryon for your products This mask saved the day after 7 hours at Legoland when I forgot to reapply sunscreen I had stuck it in the fridge when we got to the hotel and I was so happy The next morning the redness and irritation has gone , We are in the middle of an intense heat wave and Im so glad that I gave this a go It calmed my irritated skin  Store it in the fridge before you use it , Loved the fit the feel and the smell of these masks Leaves behind a residue that is a little bit sticky Otherwise would be five stars Will purchase again , Amazing Summer must have As someone who turns red if I forget to keep reapply sunscreen this is an absolute life saver Peel off BOTH layers to get to the mask Its like a 2nd skin and takes away and ouch , This mask is nice and smells very good I would recommend it for sure however the price is a bit steep for what you get"
Cleansing & Exfoliating Wipes,"these are so handy to have on me they where a little smaller than expected but they are perfect to throw into my bag when Im going anywhere , Bought 5 packs and all were dried upno productThey will not clean anything , These wipes are amazing For some reason I cant find them in stores and they dont seem to be available online either I really hope Sephora hasnt discontinued them because they are the only makeup wipes I use , I bought these Sephora wipes to use when I run out of my Sephora pads for cleaser  toner These are by far the WORST wipes Ive used They dried out my skin  did not remove makeup well , Did what I wanted it to do and better than my os by Patrick starr Just a personal opinion so if anyone is offended buy whatever brand you want I found these better than others Ive used and will purchase again Especially since it didnt dry my ski Out , Amazing wipes would absolutely recommend They are very refreshing on the face and the smell is delightful  very light witch i really like For the price aswell you cant go wrong  , Im constantly ordering the Sephora Cleansing and Exfoliating Wipes I think these are really great wipes not too thin and not too dry I use all the formulars that are hydrating moisturizing and exfoliating and I really love them all , Love love love and live for these wipes Favourite wipes with all time favourite flavour coconut If you want to buy just go for it  I just love them , Its a must  I dont know how I went without this for years , Not for the slightest of sensitive skin people Very fragrant and irritated skin , I got the Hemp wipes and while they honestly work great at removing my makeup and whatever but the perfume was burning my skin They did remove my lash glue so that was impressive After use Id have to wash my face really good after use due to how oily and slimey my skin felt afterwards , The packaging and the wipes were half the size they were last time I bought them  I will not be buying they again  The wipe isnt big enough to wipe the makeup off my face , These are just ok in a pinch They arent as wet as Id like maybe mine were just old Idk so it takes more than one to really feel like Im doing much of anything and they definitely dont remove mascara I will use them up just to refresh my face in the mornings before my skincare routine but for makeup removal they arent great I wouldnt repurchase , Awful  They use to be good the last time I purchased them I threw them away thinking they were expired  I just purchased them again today and found out through the internet that the formula has changed  They are super stinky and make me gag  Please go back to the old formula  I will be returning the ones I purchased today , I cant stand the smell or feel of these Has an old smelling fragrance and the leftover residue is very slick and gross feeling , These are super rough on sensitive skin Felt like I was cleaning my face with sandpaper Not cool I trashed them , I really like this wipe  The aloe vera is so gentle  I have no issues with this formula  There is no redness or breakouts when using it  My makeup comes off easily , The coconut one has a very weird smell to it It leaves you feeling very sticky you need to wash your face after , These are a little heavy for me The scent is overpowering and they sting my skin a little bit still clean well , I thought these would work well and smell good too but I was wrong It took 3 wipes just to get off my make up which was just mascara and eyeliner They had a smell that wasnt terrible but definitely not what I was expecting , This is SO extremely tiny that a pen is longer than the package itself I bought this online so didnt know it was so small until it arrived Will not be purchasing again , I bought the rose wipes to use when Im out of town so I dont have to pack my face wash and face cloths The package says there is No need to rinse 10 minutes later Im still wondering if this sticky feeling is going to go away on its own Im thinking the no rinse claim is not true Its hard to feel like it did the job of cleaning my face when its still sticky Next time I will try rinsing the cloth out to use as a regular face cloth at the endThe fragrance is alright I would prefer no fragrance but I wanted the hydrating wipes , Barely removes makeup and dries out super fast It made my skin feel weird after using , Super produit laisse une peau  bien exfolier parfait pour nettoyer quand on est en sortie se range trs bien dans un sac , Love love love these wipes So refreshing and cleansing that you want to use them head to toe , Literally horrible Dried out my skin and left a weird sticky film Also didnt remove any makeup literally just rearranged it Especially eye makeup Smell was decent though , Didnt like these at all Could have gotten about the same result with plain water , Blehck I hated these so bad They smelled horribleand they really dried out my face I LOVE the coconut water ones but the aloe vera ones were awful I 100 do NOT recommend , Please dont change the formula on these These are the best exfoliating wipes Ive used Ive been using for years And theyve been hard to get these days as they are constantly out of stock Sephora has changed their exfoliating wipes on the charcoal and grapefruit ones already I hope these leaves these ones alone I understand them wanting to make them CLEAN approvedbuy why change the texture of the wipes I really hope Sephora reads their reviews because everyone agrees that the previous texture with the exfoliating dots are better than the new woven textured clothes Anyhow they recently restocked aOn the 19th and I managed to scoop 5 packs I will be using sparely by cutting them on halves , Im a lazy person so I dont like makeup remover this one is perfect for me and it removes makeup very cleanly I like to use this one piece and then use some face wash very clean hope it will never be discontinued , Very very very very very very drying Do not buy this product at all , These are miniature ones not full size They smell really good and work just as good as the full size ones Also im pretty sure they have good ingredience that are good for your skin Not harsh feeling I love them  , I use this all the time especially as the makeup person for a local dance academy They are great with dual sides one as a wipe the other as an exfoliate This purchase was for my great niece who has just started using makeup I included them in her Welcome to Sephora gift box which was packed full 14lbs of Sephora samples  , These makeup wipes are sooo bomb I love the ingredients the style I think its sooo cute for makeup wipes and it feels refreshing I always want to keep it in my purse Hope they never discontinue and come more back in stock so I can stock up , These are ok a little rough on the skin though I dont wear a lot of make up so I dont know how good they would be for that but they do the trick fine Id probably not use them every day though , I got the coconut water scented minis The scent is wonderful not too strong and not the fake coconut smell They are definitely cleansing not exfoliating I would use this to remove makeup Feels great on my skin very refreshing Note that the mini size is VERY small the shape of a deck of cards but not as thick However at the time I purchased the minis were a very slightly better price per wipe 030 per wipe vs 032 for the large size I would consider buying these again they were great to add to my cart in order to get free shipping , Too rough of a texture for my sensitive skin   Fine for convenience but I would rather exfoliate properly with a separate product , They do the job well enough but isnt ideal for makeup like mascara eyelash glue eyelinerburns my eye a bit to be honest Its cute and compact though and nice if youre not doing any of the aforementioned eye makeup , These wipes were slightly irritating to my sensitive skin but they took makeup of supereasy the watermelon scent smells like candy , Smells like mens cologne on your face and its dried out , The wipes are rough on my face  it feels like paper against your skin though it smells really nice and fresh , I have been using these wipes for YEARS and I am out of my supply  every time I try to order now they are out of stock and have been for a long time Other ones cause break outs I need these Please bring them back , The new exfoliating aspect of the wipes now suck  Instead of exfoliating which the OLD ones did brilliantly these new ones are softer than an actual washcloth The old ones did a fantastic job and I am sad and annoyed they have changed and have no reason to buy them anymore , I actually laughed at the size of these wipes when I received them because I was expecting something much bigger just in a smaller quantity  Completely my fault though because it clearly says mini on the websiteBUT in spite of the size these at least the grey pack that says Detoxifying are surprisingly good  They have a very light scent which shouldnt be offensive to most people remove makeup just as well as any other wipe dont dry out the skin and where these really won me over was their exfoliating side These are not kidding around  They will exfoliate massage and bring back the circulation to your face AND neck LOL  And yet I felt no irritation or sensitivity of any kind after using them  I know we are all different when it comes to these things but I really loved these qualities and will definitely order a few more when they come back in stock  So I went from completely dismissing them in my mind when they arrived to now being in love with them By the way these wipes are manufactured in France as you can see in the pictures included , Easy to use Very hydrating When I go on trips this is what i used to wash off mascara and face oils , WHY DID SEPHORA CHANGE THEM They are DRY I have used the rose ultra moisturizing for YEARS and ALWAYS stay stocked up on them I just restocked and when I went to wipe my face it was like wiping a dry thick cloth on my face There is BARELY any moisture in the wipe I thought I got a bad pack but then opened the second one and the same Now that I have read the other reviews I see it is not my imagination WHY change something everyone loves Now I have to find a new wipe after loving these for years UNTIL THEY CHANGE THEM BACKSAVE YOUR MONEY OR YOU MIGHT AS WELL RUB A DRY CLOTH ACROSS YOUR FACE So disappointed in Sephora when these WERE the best  , Bearded Men these work great when you want to wash your face without getting suds all up in your beard  Grapefruit is my personal fav but I have only tried that and watermelon They really do leave your face feeling fresh and clean I just threw a pack in the basket one day while buying cologne and Now they are a staple product that I cant live without  No more dry beard from my face wash If you want a tough exfoliating wipe go Grapefruit if you want a smooth fresh pleasant smelling wipe go watermelon I imagine the exfoliating side would help with makeup Only certain ones have the exfoliating side so look closely at the packaging5 stars all day great product , Best wipes I ever used I couldnt order them in England so every time I came to visit my family in Canada I would stock up to take to England I have sensitive skin and this works magic , I was disappointed when I recently ordered a few packages of the grapefruit exfoliating cloths     I originally ordered the a couple of months ago and I LOVED them  great citrus scent and great exfoliation    The new cloths are a totally different fabric like gauze and have zero citrus scent , Look the lather Im all coconut products Very small and compact for a crossbody purse  great travel mate , I had been buying these coconut wipes for a few years now  recently got a couple more packs and discovered they were completely changed The wipes are thicker and textured not as wet so it requires more scrubbing The formula feels stickier on the skin as well  I used to not require rinsing my face afterward but now I do Even the packaging is worse the plastic closure doesnt seal as securely I will need to find a new product because these are terrible now , These are the best make up wipes Ive ever found They leave the skin feeling clean and moisturized Some make up wipes leave the skin feeling very oily I do not prefer the exfoliating ones however  they are too harsh for my skin , they changed this product the old wipes were great and soft and took your make up off perfectly this new version of these wipes leave your face sticky and with makeup left behind this new version is horrible will be returning all the sephora wipes i just bought , Enjoying the exfoliating side Pretty rough you have to be carful not to rub too hard The other side is comforting after you exfoliate , They made my skin feel really fresh as my on the go type of makeup removercleanser I do prefer to actually wash my face when I get home or before I go to bed but if Im in the car and out  about these do the trick , A NEW MUST in my pursebackpackcarryon good for on the go cleansing wipe cant tell about makeup remover bc dont use muchsoft smell not a soft material , This used to be THE BEST makeup removing wipe But this last package of it I just purchased the formulation was totally different It still did a great job of cleaning but it left a greasy residue all over my skin No indicator on the package that was a new formula or anything , For some reason it wont let me review the grapefruit wipes which are what I ordered I ordered them back in June  and they had the exfoliating side Sounds as if maybe they no longer have the rough exfoliating side which is a shame It took me a little adjusting to get used to them because the exfoliating side is pretty strong But I really love the grapefruit fragrance and came to appreciate how well they exfoliate I normally use some kind of exfoliating treatment or serum every night but didnt have to when I used the grapefruit wipes Theyre fabulously effective If they have the same formulation available Ill be ordering them often Im in my 50s and dont have particularly sensitive skin FYI , Gentle on skin Cleans well Unscented Didnt use it on makeup , I ordered a restock of the exfoliating wipes and found out that the wipes are completely different The exfoliating side is gone and the material is different These new wipes left my face feeling sticky and greasy Its sooo sad because these were my goto facial wipes for my very sensitive skin , I use to love the charcoal exfoliating wipes Then they went out of stock forever I tried the charcoal gentle exfoliating wipes and I am not a fan of those at all The 5 stores are for the wipes that use to be available , These are nice to have on hand Not sure if they are doing anything extra but they are not breaking me out so thats cool , I have gone through at least 5 packages of Hemp and at least 8 of Rose Recently Hemp changed from smooth on both sides to smooth on one side exfoliating on the other Its not very abrasive  just different and with dubious improvement Overall its an average productI am taking 2 stars off because Sephora quietly reduced the cloths from 25 to 20 but kept the price the same Its cheaper to buy from the drugstore and with comparable if not better quality , Sadly these made my face and eyes burn so bad after using them I have never had an issue with makeup removers till trying this one The smell is a little strange also , New formula sucks I was a years long user of the originals Do not like the change  Better off using an unscented baby wipe sprayed with my foaming cleanser  Cheaper and better than these redesigned ones , The New Formula is AWFUL I have been using these for years and I loved the rose and the watermelon scents Recently repurchased and believe the reviews this has definitely been reformulated and it is terrible So aggressively fragranced and it does not fade plus it leaves my face feeling sticky not fresh Hard pass for me There are drugstore alternatives that are better performing at a lower price point , Love these wipes Just had a baby and these have been so easy to use when Im exhausted and dont want to fully wash my face in the morning or before bed , Easy breezy beautiful Sephora Girl Or in other words Easy to use smells great and takes off my makeup easily , Perfect for your gym bag or to have on the go No sticky residue and works for stubborn eyeliner , Absolutely loved these charcoal wipes and would regularly buy them Saw they were out of stock so I was so happy to see them in store Unfortunately the formula has changed and it is not as exfoliating and totally not the same Will not be buying anymore , bought a small pack of the hemp ones at Sephora Love them and they smell great , Leaves my face sticky but still love the refreshment , These wipes smells really nice but were not the best at removing any makeup and left my skin feeling irritated , love having these on hand during the hot summer days hold up well for playground duty airport freshen or event makeup prep , I used to love these wipes but I purchased them recently for the first time since the pandemic and they are not the same They made my face feel extra sticky the scent wasnt off and it was overall an uncomfortable experience , Like many others I was a fan of these wipes I have sensitive skin and found the coconut wipes and the rose worked well for me I still had some in my supply but I ordered three packs along with some other items to qualify for free shipping I have been extremely disappointed in the updated formula  They have changed both the material used for the cleansing cloth thicker and more like fabric and the formula for the liquid While I prefer the former material the newer is OK but not great What Im having a much harder time with is the formula for the cleanser itself What used to be lightly scented and refreshing is now cloying and leaves an unwanted sticky residue on my skin I find I have to rub harder for the product to be effective  Rest assured this will be the last time I purchase these Ick Now to find a way to use them elsewhere so they are not wasted   , Perfection Removes the makeup and exfoliate Not drying skin at all , Please bring back the old exfoliating wipes The new ones dont do anything These were a staple for me for years and now Im so dissatisfied Your makeup wipes were the reason for me ordering through Sephora over ulta , I do love these wipes There are others I like as well but the price point is so good with Sephora That said the packaging isnt always the best and the plastic lid frequently falls off the package that the wipes are stored in Other than that I love them , I find these wipes actually really rough to use on the face so I decided to use them to exfoliate my legs and my arms sometimes and it works super well It is really great at removing dead skin Just wouldnt recommend for more sensitive areas like the face , I wanted to like these cause theyre cheap and smell nice But these wipes are honestly so harsh to the skin They leave an oily film on your face and they barely remove any makeup I cleansed after using them and they still made me break out and I dont even have sensitive skin , I love these Super convenient The rough side is the most exfoliating cleansing cloth Ive ever used to date and the soft side is perfection , Great facial wipes to remove makeup while cleansing and exfoliating face Obsessed with the coconut water hydration and doesnt leave my skin dry , Very happy with this It does a good job cleaning I use it before bed Quality vs price is good , Kind of smells funky and makes me lips dry but it does the job really well so  , None of these are good for my face Too harsh and always leave some kind of film behind But while trying to use up the wipes to not waste any I found out they work great for refreshing armpits and feet The exfoliating side is awesome for armpits and feet Keeping them feet smooth and armpits light colored I still use glycolic acid on them overnight 2 times a week I just cant replace my lcd deodorant , Love love love this product I love the way it smells it cleanses your face sooooooooo well removes make really well Your skin smells and looks refreshed after using it , I love these and you seriously cannot beat the price I see no reason to pay up for cleansing wipes is these Sephora ones do the job perfectly I would recommend to try out a bunch of different flavors Ive tried them all and my favorites are watermelon and coconut water They dont leave you dry , I really like these I have super sensitive skin and they dont make me break out , I love these cloths  The first thing I noticed was the scent The grapefruit scent was just like the real thing  When they are opened up they were very moist  One side was very smooth and the other side was a bit rougher  My skin felt clean and soft  I will continue to purchase , Doesnt remove makeup Wipes were barely moist when I opened the package , It is very hard on the skin I bought it 2 years ago and I could only use it twice Now I use it for cleaning surfaces because it is not good for my face , Even the soft side feels rough and it doesnt take off my makeup without a lot of harsh scrubbing Awful , Great wipes and NO breakouts Refreshing moisturizing and removes all my makeup , Stung my face and eyes scent was over powering These wipes are great in theory but Ill stay away until a fragrance free version is released , super rough on face doesnt really remove well odd smell didnt really like it overall , Im so glad its not just me that noticed the change in the charcoal wipes First the package got smaller then the formula became inconsistent Im down to my last package  along with the green tea Now those are gone Whats up Sephora Do you have to change everything , I love these wipes They make my skin feel so clean They gently reIve makeup and oil and they smell great You get lots for the price too , So not only did the packaging change but the whole wipe itself has changed Im not sure if I like it yet but I loved the previous version especially the exfoliating side This new design smells different and is a thicker material like a wash cloth The exfoliating side is more gentle which some people may like , These facial wipes are great Scrubby side soft side very nice scent These will be my fave from now on , I love these grapefruit exfoliating wipes They smell real fresh and have a course side for smoothing my face while getting ready for the summers sun after a very long winter Will be sharing these with all my good friends , I love these wipes Fast easy and effectively clean my makeup away , They smell very great and make the face feel refreshing and soft , These used to be my FAVORITE wipes The coconut and the charcoal were amazing Now the formula is different and the wipes are awful You also only get 20 wipes not 25 I also think the coconut water wipes stink like coconuts when they used to have almost no scent at all Why did you guys ruin a good thing Please please change the formula back No one likes these now I dont even know what wipes I can use now since I used these for years and my skin loved them So disappointed and frustrated , I have been enjoying the Charcoal Exfoliating wipes for years but you have changed them They have gone from 25 wipes down to 20 and you have downgraded the exfoliating side of the wipe It does nothing now No abrasion at all anymore just nothing little soft texture Used to love these wipes but will not purchase them again Disappointed , Please bring back the old formula The new formula wipes are awful Theyre not damp enough the texture is weird and they smell strange and leave a sticky film on the skin These wipes used to be my favorite but I will not be repurchasing since they changed the formula , I tried this product in the rose and coconut types I enjoyed using both very much highly effective in removing all makeup but I prefer to use this as the first step of a double cleansing routine These are especially useful on the go super handy for travel to freshen up My only complaint with these is the fragrance can cause some sensitivity to my skin It would be super helpful if there were a fragrancefree option , I have been buying these for a while I work in an environment that wreaks havoc on my skin These are fantastic at the end of my day or even to refresh my face on my lunch break I typically buy in multiples and came online to purchase my next batch only to discover that they dont sell my favourite scent coconut in Canada anymore I am absolutely devasted I hope this is only temporary as I will be gutted using my last wipe knowing I wont be able to get more Please make the coconut available soon again for your Canadian customers PLEASE , I have been using these wipes daily for over a year now I used to love them but they changed the packaging and formula The wipes are now so dry they are basically unusable I got two packages and opened them both to discover that the wipes were barely damp It feels they had been sitting out in the sun to dry out Wont be repurchasing , These wipes are excellent They smell nice they work really well and are affordable Whats not to love , Great Will reorder again love the smell gets makeup off face really well , I didnt like at all it will dry out my skin and its said smell like coconut but smell something else , I got the coconut ones they smell amazing They are thick and take off any makeup or just help cleanse No water needed They work well , Amazing scent great exfoliant and gentle on the other side Feels fresh and clean  , Love these They smell amazing and do a great job Theyre also a bit moisturizing , Obsessed with Rose anything and these are amazing Works great Only wish they were a tad bit cheaper but Ill still buy , Irritated my sensitive acne prone skin My skin around the eyes turned red and stung from these Use a cleansing balm instead , I love these for when I do a full face of makeup and want to take it off after a long day I use one of these wash my face and do my regular skincare routine Also they just feel really nice on my face I use the Aloe coconut watermelon and rose the most As the texture of some of the other wipes are more like a scrub , MehI wasnt impressed  It took several wipes to remove all my makeup and it wasnt able to get my mascara off  The wipes left a sticky weird film on my face  I gave it 2 stars because the smell was nice , Wish they would bring these back permanently again  , Works well when your on the go but I still would rather use micellar water because it is better for the planet but otherwise it works good when your in a hurry , It could totally clean my make up and my face wasnt dry at all , Amazing if you like exfoliating swipe These are the best exfoliating wipes Ive tried They are aggressive enough to get the dead skin and makeup off My skin glows after use The grapefruit fragrance is very energizing and pleasant I keep repurchasing these , i didnt expect these to get eye makeup off as easily as they do plus they make my face soft would recommend , Sephora Collection Cleansing  Exfoliating wipes smell amazing and remove a full face of makeup with ease , These babes are my favourite from the line  Easy to store and they help to take away mascara or any left traces of make up Never change them pleeeeese , watermelon had too much scent not overbearing but unpleasent and not as nice as other brands wipes that are more natural and rated for pricevalue Main ingredients coco and castor oil with alcohol Small wipes and package for travel Wont return nor repurchase nor use for face , These are great smelling wipes and remove all my makeup But they are not exfoliating like the charcoal wipes are , Im hating the new formula Old wipes used to be so much better for exfoliation The texture actually worked for my dry flaky skin I just used their new formula and its horrible Texture is not good enough at all It does not feel like its exfoliating anything These used to be my go to wipes for years and now I have to find something else , Does the job fairly well It takes the make up off but I would not herald it as a skin hydrating or immediate fix However as a wipe I do recommend I typically use wipes as a first step to removing make up and also when I am doing my make up to clean off brushes quickly Otherwise I do not recommend this product for the soothing and relaxing it promises However as a cleansing wipe it does work , Hi I always recommend clean products These wipes are fantastic these are thick like a shop cloth papertowel level thick  one is all you need to stay refreshed The wipes have two sides one is soft the other is bumpy  rougher  like an exfoliating pad I always buy these but the new formula sucks Drys the skin Feels very weird Hope they bring the old one back Good to see I am not the only one that feels this way , These wipes are fantastic these are thick like a shop cloth papertowel level thick  one is all you need to stay refreshed The wipes have two sides one is soft the other is bumpy  rougher  like an exfoliating pad I have bought the charcoal for a gift  he loved them Aloe Vera was a gift  they loved them and I really like the Bamboo , i liked the mini watermelon wipes it did take off liquid lipstick swatches it could be because i got the mini pack but the wipes should be bigger i figured mini pack meant fewer wipes than the normal pack if theyre not bigger in the normal pack then these are great for traveling , I always buy these but the new formula sucks Drys the skin Feels very weird Hope they bring the old one back Good to see I am not the only one that feels this way , Ive only ever used the new formula and they do the job at taking off face make up or as a refresher when my face feels all grimey I would not recommend using it to take off mascara though especially water proof mascara since I feel like I really need to scrub at my eyes which is not pleasant They smell nice"
Crystal Facial Roller Set,"Originally purchased this for my under eyes It feels very enlivening especially when cold Recently tho I have found it is very effective for massaging my shin splints  Fun to have the different crystals too , Amazing set of tools that provide immediate results Well worth the price too , This is amazing I leave mine in my mini fridge and I just wish there was more videos on the SEPHORA COLLECTION for this particular production for review must have  very soothing makes u look awake , I received this as a sample and was pleasantly surprised Id never gotten onto the roller craze and thanks to this gift Im hooked The balls do track a little stiff sometimes but I really think thats just a quirk of natural stone having treads drilled into them I love that it helps make the most of my skincare products and seems to help them better hydrate my skin I do think a longermore cylindrical stone would be better though being a sphere theres very little of the crystal touching your face at a time  not efficient with surface area if that makes sense That said this does make it heavenly to use over temples and undereyes Good value with 3 crystals , I bought this over a year ago and use it a few times each month I didnt have any issues with the balls rolling correctly I keep mine in the freezer to a refreshing facial before bed , I was so excited to use this because of all the hype around it but soon found out that it was very uncomfortable due to the size Along with being small it broke within two weeks for no reason at all , my favorite stone to use is the amethyst I keep mine in the freezer because it gets super cold and makes my face feel good when Im hot Also depuffs my puffy face in the mornings , I used these for a few weeks when they broke I am able to pop the rollers back on but they castle rollers come off easily , Cute little set but quite overpriced for what it is Two out of the three gemstone roller heads dont roll well at all they get stuck and I end up just sliding them over my skin instead of rolling Additionally the rollers are quite small so it takes a long time to actually roll your face and neck Not very convenient , This is a fun set to have in your facial tool collection with 3 different roller heads to use and once used onto the face it feel very nice if put in the fridge Just wish it hug on the face better , Love these they are great for mini facials and fave massages , I love this product the stones are perfect size I use it everyday , Broken item the ball is cracked How can you use on face The staff not helpful to file a refund but insist it is not the quality control problem Be prepare to cut your face when using it , FYI You can get the same exact set  same packaging different brand from TJ MAXX for 999 , Love this product Although I would recommend buying different shapes instead of different crystals , Love that the roller is small and can be used on the eyes I throw the pouch in the freezer and definitely helps with lymphatic drainage , I like the set however the green ball isnt threaded properly so it wont stay on the wand This was my first purchase and I had read other reviews before I ordered with the same problem so its abit annoying Are they not tested by quality control before packaging , I have been using them for about a week now and I have found it has helped a lot The balls are extremely cooling to touch and especially with the weather getting hot it is refreshing It has also helped my acne because I use this to put on my serums and I find since my hands are typically clamy or oily its reduced that going on my face Highly recommend and for the price I think it is worth it , I love this product I know facial rollers are in right now but I had yet to see one with not only an interchangeable head but also with a completely round crystal Right out of the box the rose quartz was extremely cooling on my face and helped with the puffiness above my brows It works wonders with serums If youre someone who struggles with headaches or allergies this is a great product to calm those issues as well The product also feels sturdy and well made I recommend it , All three crystals are usable good condition and threaded properly Only ONE issue the jade and amethyst had hot glue stuck on themI had to take them off with alcohol which worked fine You get what you pay for I guess , After searching for a gua sha and a facial roller I settled on this one by Sephora I liked that it had three interchangeable rollers This thing is truly amazing It really does push serums into your skin It feels great on the skin Even my husband loves this thing I highly recommend it , I can only use 2 of the three crystals because the purple one isnt threaded properly and wont screw on The pink and green are fine I have a typical jade roller and I like the eye roller on this since its smaller and more comfortable I just wish I could use all three since that was why I bought them , I LOVE THESE LITTLE BALLS WHATS BEST IS AFTER YOU PLACE THEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR THAN USE THEM THE COLD MARBLESI CALL THEM REALLY HELPED WITH DEPUFFING MY EYES AND THEY FELT SO SMOOTH GLIDINGOVER MY BROW BONE  I DONT NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COLORS THEMSELVES BUT I THINK THATS JUSTA GIMMICK ANYWAY BUT THE DEVISE DOES WORK GREAT , This is my first roller so I dont have much for reference BUT I think it feels great I love the three heads I gave 4 stars because the round roller is pretty small I wish it could be a bit bigger to cover more area , Seemed like a great deal but didnt work very well Feels good on skin especially after being in the fridge but the roller was defective and doesnt roll well especially not with moisturizer , I received a broken product and will definitely be returning this item I was really looking forward to using it , So small and it was really hard taking the crystals off of the wand and it squeaked whenever I used it Had to return it , I love this especially the amethyst one as it helps me fall asleep faster I put this in the fridge for better effect , the feeling of this roller on my face felt like the nicest massage ever it easily unscrews the only thing is I have a hard time remembering what each crystal has for benefits so I wish it said on the bag so I could recycle the packaging , This product does exactly what I expected It makes my skin feel great and a bonus that I didnt expect theres serious calming properties After a long work day or just dealing with the way things go in the world around us this helps with my anxiety tremendously A few minutes of roiling before I go to sleep and Im out like a light Thank you for this set I highly recommend , Un peu inutile mais un luxe de dtente  Definitivement il faut les mettre au frigo avant de les rouler sur notre visage avec un peu dhuile de srum cest un plaisir coupable pour le visage surtout sous les yeux   laver et dsinfecter aprs chaque utilisation , I bought this for a friend of mine and she said shes been using it everyday Im glad she likes it , I have been using this since December I like it a lot It feels very nice and relaxing i use it when I apply my skincare to give it a slip to glide across I roll from the middle out and up I have briefly read about the benefits of rolling but cant say that I see any long last effects just yet I think this is a great starting set to try and experiment with different stones Its wallet friendly and I think its well made , I was so excited to try this only to find out that the rose quarts roller that it came with wont detach  Very frustrated and will be returning , I love this little lip scrub smells great even tastes good Feels really nice when you just leave it on and feel the grains , I was so excited to purchase this as i couldnt decide which crystal to buy and this seemed like a good investment all in one But it broke as i was taking it out of the packaging I took the amethyst crystal out and the silicone piece holding the little bracket iN place popped out and was nowhere to be found since it is tiny and clear After that the crystal was wabbly and i returned it I will look for another product  so dissapointed , Love this set I did have to knock down one star however because they put this sticky goop on the stone rollers to Stick to the plastic packaging Well this goop is almost impossible to get off It was very difficult I specifically like the size of these circle rollers for under the eye area after my night creams , This roller set is amazing I put it in the fridge and use it to help when I get migraines It feels amazing and helps with the pain It was tricky to swap out the different stones at first but I think it just takes a little to be broken in I dont know what it is but I swear each stone feels different This has been a great purchase for me , Ive never used facial rollers before this set of 3 is the perfect way to try it out for a fraction of the price of buying just one As for the reviews where people are saying its hard to pull the rose quartz head off its a screw not a plug I had no difficulty whatsoever Also wasnt hard to take out of the packaging the heads are glued down but its the type of glue that satisfactorily peels off completely Overall its great for massaging your face oils in feels so nice on the skin Its got a weight to it making it feel its of good quality One star off just because I havent seen any noticeable difference yet but Ive also only used it a couple of times Its fun and relaxing though , A friend started carrying some crystals as a way to channel negative energybe more positive I joked I should get her a facial roller Her birthday came up and I got one for each of us I opened up mine and used it the day I got it I took note of the reviews that said the heads are impossible to removesuper difficult THE HEADS ARE THREADED AND SCREW IN AND OUT Im not trying to assume some people tried to just pull it out but mine twisted with less effort than it takes for me to open a bottle of soda Yes the pieces are stuck with a dollop of glue to the packaging This didnt bother me one bit especially as I was able to grab the edge and pull off the glue in less then 5 seconds No big deal at all I have no idea if this works to reduce puffiness or any of that jazz I bought it to encourage me to take care of my skin weekly peel moisturizing every day It is incredibly easy for me to forget and Im reaching an age where forgetting isnt an option lol I did try this out when I got a headachemigraine It worked incredibly well way better than trying to rub my face with my hands It was an unexpected benefit and makes it worth it for me on this reason alone , I wanted to love this but only two of the balls will attach I like the two that work otherwise nice quality and it comes in a cute pouch but am disappointed , Its a great buy I wish the handle or the stones were bigger I put them in the fridge until Im ready to use them It does feel a little cheap but for the price you cannot expect better , I love them they are so cute and they have helped me with the puffiness around my eyes , Do I need it Nah Do I love it HECK YEAH Its very soothing and relaxing to do Helps win selfcare and makes me feel fancy , This would have five stars however I havent been able to change the heads Its impossible to unscrew the quartz roller from the handle , I am so pleased with this product The only bad thing I can talk about is the packaging its a bit hard to open and the stones are glued in which left a residue that had to be cleaned off that was annoying but once cleaned up is a great quality product Some reviews spoke of the colour of the stones not being all that nice and hard to screw onoff but I did not find this the stones are a lovely colour and are easy to use and switch up It makes my face feel and look great This was a great addition to my daily and nightly skin care rituals Highly recommend especially at the price , I was so excited to get these but disappointed when I realized how unergonomic the handle that came with it felt in my hand I decided to go ahead and redesign a new handle for it My boyfriend had never seen crystal rollers before and was delighted at the prospect of getting a rub with one but he was also saddened that only one roller head can be used at once BTW Im not sure what the difference is between the three heads other than color The Mohs hardness of quartz is 7 and so is amethyst Jade is between 6 and 7 hardness So for those who claim they feel different well they really arent Theyre literally all the same hardness So its just an aesthetic thing I guess Anyway after some CAD modeling work we came up with a selftapping 3ball ergo holder so that all 3 balls can be used simultaneously for an epic back massage I attached photos of what these look like all mounted together The handle was 3D printed on my Prusa FDM printer using Taulman Bridge nylon Added bonus the nylon handle can be dyed so Im debating what color to make it though I kind of like the all white natural nylon look with the rose quartz amethyst and jade balls It should also be noted that some of my crystals werent completely spherical One was even slightly flat on one side I use this primarily for back massages so its actually not too noticeable but just be aware of variation in their manufacturing process I plan to upload my handle CAD file to Thingiverse or other model sites as an open source file if anyone else has a printer and wants to make it  , I love the size of this roller and the option to switch out the balls My boyfriend and I actually designate the jade one for our body We both have small frames and the rollers just seem to massage our backs at the right pressure And I dont really notice the roller being squeaky The cooling sensation on a hot summer night is great Would definitely recommend , Im super indecisive so having three options is perfect It is not as big as it looks in the picture It feels wonderful on my skin as well as my boyfriends Feels like a mini massage  , I have been very curious about crystal rollers for a while and this was a costeffective way to try them out I cant necessarily say I notice anything specific in terms of depuffing vs radiance from the various crystal heads but what I do like is this provides a really nice facial massage which is soothing and I think a nice part of my skincare routine I prefer the amethyst roller as it is the smoothest the jade one has scraping sound against the bar in the middle think it needed more sanding and I use it after washing my face in the morning and evenings I rub it over the various parts of my face and like any massage its a pleasant and relaxing sensation The rollers do pick up facial oil and to clean them I wash them with baby soap and warm water I think the real benefit is the relaxing massage and increased circulation from the pressure Its also cool against the skin in the warmer weather which is also a nice touch , I returned this because there was glue stuck to everything from the packaging Its also super heavy and I decided to stick with my trusty Mount Lai jade roller , Two of the heads barely screw on and the amethyst orb is cracked Ill use it for now but will definitely save up to buy a more reputable brand because I do like the feel of the one head that DOES screw on all the way , Just got mine and i am disappointed that one of the three roller doesnt even screw onsarcastic clap it sucks I can only use two out of three roller and one seem really loose and I predict it may fall off quite soon and it came like that Not worth my money I should have waited kept my money and buy a better quality one Also one make a squeaky sounds when rolling it not enjoyable to hear but hey its rolling i guess , Very good and high quality productcomfortable and cold It is easily to twist and change the crystal headI dont know why some people said it was difficult , I love the shape and the quality I was disappointed that the amethyst I received is basically clear and the rose quartz and jade are both pale imitations of what is pictured  If you are buying it for a gift or if you care about the look of the crystals buy it in store rather than online , I am really happy I purchased this after the jade roller I purchased off of amazon broke I spent 10 more and ended up with 3 different stones to choose from The design is really nice its pretty and I look forward to decompressing with this at the end of the day , I think this set is great  relatively affordable high quality and very smooth Personally I did not have any trouble getting the rollers out of the box I like to store the stones and roller in the fridge when Im not using them and it feels so good after taking them out Great for waking yourself up in the morning or helping puffy bloated cheeks While the difference in my face puffiness isnt super noticeable I definitely feel more relaxed and my skin feels a bit tighter Would highly recommend , Love this roller Its made of metal and is super sturdy The little stones are smooth and feel cool on your face The price is reasonable compared to other rollers Great purchase , This was fun to use I cant say I see any huge longterm benefits but the cooling sensation depuffs my skin immediately and if you like to use an oil on your face like I do it feels amazing to use with this roller Is it necessaryabsolutely not But its a fun addition to your skin care regimen if you have the extra time , I love it rolls easy holds cool temp and looks beautiful , Ive been using this for almost a month now Im using the roller every morning and I noticed that it reduce the puffiness of my under eye I like keeping my roller in the fridge for a cooling sensation which really helps reduce undereye swelling and puffiness , These are so amazing I love them Put them in the fridge for 2030 minutes and it feels so nice on your face , I dont understand how this set got such good reviews Mine came in defective The amethyst head doesnt twist on at all the jade head screws on smoothly but is sitting on an angle So the only good head is the rose quartz one Not very well made I will have to bring it back On the other hand Im a gemologist and just from looking at it I dont believe the jade is nephrite For the price I dont expect getting jadeite but if it isnt nephrite it shouldnt be called jade at all , I really like this during or after a face mask The rocks or crystals are always cool and I dont put them in the fridge , This to me is wonderful Yes straight out of the fridge The puffiness is almost instantly reduced It made my tired eyes I spend my day at a computer feel worlds better Keeping it handy when I am working Only minor complaint  I wish the amethyst ball was more purple Mine looks essentially clear like straight quartz But then again  a rock is a rock and it is still cool and smooth , Loved this set at the first sight when I received it Tried a few times  very practical and elegant No doubt that it worth the price Love love love , I have used this product 3 times since receiving it yesterday I LOVE it I was going back and forth and putting it in and out of my cart about 100 times I am so glad that I finally bought it Its fairly inexpensive but feels pricey and luxurious The handle has some weight to it and the crystal heads feel so cooling and relaxing on my cheeks and eyes If youre deciding whether or not to buy it do yourself a favor and just buy it , Awesome product So relaxing But how do I get it off I want to try all three and you need to be the hulk to get that thing off  , I only purchased this set because I casually used the sample roller while waiting in line OMG The cooling affect was beyond amazing and the relaxing cooling soothing sensation lasted for at least ten minutes after I used it I am really glad that I purchased it I even used it on my husband who wouldnt stop stammering about my love obsession with makeup products and Sephora but once the roller touched his face his mouth stoppedpriceless , If youre hesitating to buy this set buy it Its great value for your money The set feels very luxurious and not cheap The roller and stones all have a nice weight to them The storage bag is great to throw your roller into and pop into the fridge I highly recommend , I love this roller set The stones stay naturally cool from the ambient temperature in my house no refrigerator needed I roll my face before bed and when I wake up Its ultra soothing and this is a very high quality roller compared to what Ive had in the past Heavy and well constructed It was a bit of a pain to get it out of the package but once removed worth every bit of hassle Ive had mine a few weeks now and so far so amazing , Did I need this No But do I love using it Absolutely Its very well made and the heads are the perfect size and shape I keep them in the fridge and they actually stay cool longer than I expected when I use them I use this when I do my skincare when I have time to help with puffiness When theyre cold they actually help with headaches too Roll it gently over the sinus area and temples and it really helps Again is it a necessity No but it is worth the money if youre in the market for a luxury item , Very nice addition to my skin care routine  I place it in the refrigerator for an extended cooling affect Works great , LOVE THIS The handle feels super luxe and heavy and the crystals feel just as amazing as well Defiantly worth the buy It was a little hard to remove the rose crystal at first but thankfully I got my fianc to help and now they remove really easily , Best produce ever I had a jade roller already but selling the 3in1 is super practical and they are sturdy too No smell No noise I actually SEE INSTANT RESULTS , First time roller here I love it Its a ritual for me when I finish my skincare and take a head out of the fridge and onto my roller and begin rolling It feels so relaxing and soothing In terms of benefits I notice some depuffing in my cheeks This roller feels incredibly lux and I love that it comes with 3 heads 1010 , 3 stars because all three stones have different rolling abilities the jade rolls the most effortlessly while the rose quartz and amethyst are more difficult to roll this might just be an individual product characteristic , Bought this product today and I like it but for some reason I cant change my crystal because the original one is impossible to get off I dont know if Im doing it wrong but its very frustrating cause I wanna try all three crystals  , I was planning to buy multiple facial rollers to get different stones but when I saw this set had three for such a good price I decided to give it a try I am definitely glad that I made this purchase The quality is amazing It is true that the packaging is difficult to open but once you get it open its fine , To start Im usually very skeptical about things like this actually working Since Ive always wanted a roller but didnt want to spend the money I thought this three in one was a good deal and would be a relaxing thing to do As soon as I got it I used the jade roller good for contouring and de puffing the right side of my face and no joke I saw a visible difference in how it contoured my cheek and got rid of the puffiness It also feels like a dream to roll on your face which is the main reason I bought it Overall its very sturdy and the bag is cute I put all the crystals In the bag without the handle and stick it in the freezer so I have my pick of which one I want to use that day I l o v e it Highly recommend , pretty great my previous jade roller broke so i picked this up to replace it it works just as well and the smaller size of the actual stones fits better into the contours of my face Overall this is a better value than that roller , Great product The stones are the perfect size and its by no means cheaply made Im enjoying it a lot and I saved a lot of money by not buying each roller separate , I could barely get this out of the boxes the pieces were glued in and that left residue all over the crystal heads so disappointed in that , Made from metal and has some weight to it No plastic Three different tops screw on and off Each ball is about the size of a gumball that you would receive from gumball machine as a child Handle seems to be a rose gold that is about 4 inches or so in length Comes with cream colored pouch for storage Stones are wonderful and great chilled , I really like this roller set I keep mine in the freezer because my eyes are swollen in the morning and it feels amazing to roll the cold crystals across my eyes and face I like this one better than the standard ones , Its pretty and heavy Crystals are really calming but I cant unscrew to change the crystals"
Deluxe Facial Roller Set,"I really love all the attachments however its definitely a maintenance tool I tried using it as step one for my face massage and kept popping the poor little pink attachment off Havent tried the other ones yet hopefully that can stand up to my hulk strength , So far so good Made with sturdy metal handle idk which type sorry and has a good weight to it Heads are easily interchangeable My only complaint is the obsidian popped out from the metal prongs that held it together but it was easy to fix Lovely addition to my skincare routine"
Double-Ended Textured Facial Roller,"I dont think it did anything  I def wouldnt have paid the full price for it , but I did not really like the textured side of it  It was a little rough even though I used it very gently , Didnt do anything I returned it Embarrassing to sell something worse than what you find at the dollar store at sephora , I love the way this feels on my skin Gives a nice cooling effect , A lovely addition to the facial and body massage tools Ive been enjoying trying out on myself and my partner as we have various aches and pains with having to sit around working on our computers day in day out This facial tool had been on my radar for a while and I grabbed it as soon as I saw this go on sale and it is really a great 2 in 1 facial massage delight You can easily use this before or after any part of your skincare routine or as a stand alone tool just to get the tension out of the face Massage tools come pretty expensive so I cant even knock this for being a little squeaky as metal on metal would be as it has just the right amount of heft to it to feel like it is doing something without having to press down on the skin , I have been using the textured side on my scalp and the smooth side on my face , Not at all quality and in fact cannot use after any product It smells like metal Dont like it at all , The rollerball stays cold even if I dont put this in the fridge and it feels wonderful first thing in the morning before I do my skin care The textured end is great for releasing tension in my sinus areas and I also have been using it to give my lips a bit of a plumping effect before putting on balm as prep for lipstick , Loved it while it worked about 2 weeks then the pin in the microneedle side fell so it wont roll anymore on the face , Absolutely love it Doesnt feel so cheaply made has a nice weight to it Very relaxing and all you need is gentle pressure to stimulate your lymp drainage You can really feel the texture side on your forehead and your lip area You know where the skin is thinner but it isnt unpleasant"
Eyebrow Razor Set,"Its like cutting your eyebrows with an old rust nail Save your skin and dont get this product , no need to go to the esthetician anymore easy and fast to use with good results and the product is cheap , Works great Nice and sharp Easy to use Cap so I dont cut myself Nice that the cap has comb and bristle brush , Does the job just sharp so be careful Dont feel the need to buy a brand razor or any tool because the Sephora collection is affordable and works the same , I love these Ive tried many different ones and every time I wish I had just repurchased these The price is good and I love how small the blades are It makes it super easy to use and allows you to be really precise Great results every time I use these mostly to clean up around my brows but sometimes use them to dermaplane as well , This product is easy to use and removes unwanted hairs There is one thing Id like to mention that the blade is very dull and Ive cut my skin with it It cuts your skin easily and you must be careful used How fast you maneuver with it or how hard you press down can cut you I still recommend this hair removal tool I just didnt expect it to cut me so easily Hope that helps , These razors are pretty good nothing wrong with them so far you just have to know how to use them otherwise your going to get cuts in your face"
Face Mask Applicator,"I dont love this or hate it I do like scooping my product from the jar with a spatula for cleanliness but as a delivery source to my skin my hands work much better , Made my spa night 100x easier and messfree The smooth side helped evenly spread a small amount of charcoal mask all over my face without getting any mask on my hands The bumpy removal side definitely helped scrub the mask off and make it a quicker process , i love this applicator i dont have to worry about my nails getting in the way , so much easier to use i love it best applicator for so cheap recommend , I love this mask applicator I dont have to worry about using my hands to spread the mask on my face and this helps apply it nicely and also scrub off any mask residue after the mask is dry , This mask applicator is a must have I use the spatula to apply the gel for my foreo bear mini and the brush to wipe the gel off before washing my face Super useful , I have long nails and this is a life saver Especially when scrabbling product from jars It is multipurpose I use it to apply masks cream moisturizer etc , Great for those container masks that you dont want to dip your finger into  , I use this thing every day Perfect for my long nailed friends that are tired of using their knuckles to get products out of jars I know its not the original purpose but its been a game changer , I use this Face Mask Applicator for using and putting on facial mask for self care Sunday Its relaxing and refreshing and after that my face feels good clean and beautiful afterwards , durable material and i like that its a simple design , I love this applicator I use this to apply masks and moisturizers so I can avoid getting germs into my skincare products Its easy to clean too , The actual mask applicator side works incredibly well but the scrub brush side has been pretty useless especially with thick mud masks its no match for those , I really like this This is the first mask application tool Ive used and I am never going back to using my fingers The brush end is great for massaging away clay with water its gentle but does a good job , Does exactly what you need it to Makes it so much easier to get a good scrub from my face washes and loosen up dry masks , In love  This tool is a gamechanger  I find this more hygienique than my fingers  , Great at applying masks Also a great teether if your child gets a hold of it , I used a clay mask for reference It doesnt say this on the packaging but I wet the mask a little before massaging it which you could do with your handy dandy tool w the other side of the bristles My back hurts after I wash my face over the sink so reducing that is a huge plus It takes a while to massage with the mask I used but Id rather take massage my face standing up or sitting down than having to be bent over scrubbing my face away for the same amount of time maybe even longer highly recommend , How did I love without this handy little tool I love it It makes putting on mask so much easier then when its ready to come off a little massaging with the bristle end and rinse I would highly recommend this product , Cons I wish the handle was a bit stiffer and I wish the nubbly end tapered a bit moreIts nice to use for masks but its also really great for massaging my face , This is a great tool I use every day to remove my moisturizer from the container Incredible for those with long nails who dont want to waste the product getting stuck under your nails , I bought this to try with a new face mask I purchased that came in a jar Its so easy to use and easy to clean I love this Its my new favourite facial tool , I really like it honestly I use clay mask a lot it easily to apply clay on my face and to use the opposite side to take clay off If you are a clay mask person Highly recommend , Feels more hygenic to use this face mask applicator to apply the face masks I have that are in jars or bottles The spatula end helps ensure an even layer of the face mask is being applied and the scrubby end helps make sure Ive gotten the face mask off once its ready to come off , I really like this tool as it is double ended One end helps with precision and not to waste as much product I found And the other end is nice to help scrub off the mask afterwards Nothing overly exciting about this tool but it does work and not expensive , Love this product Great way to hygienically and evenly apply clay face masks in the jar  Its a new essential item for me , I bought the pink one when it was still available and Im not impressed The spatula end works great but I mostly got this for the other end the little scrub brush thing as I already owned face mask spatulas and I was really disappointed It definitely does NOT remove any kind of mask from your face If you have a gel or cream mask on itll just spread the product around and not do anything and if you have a mud mask you have to rub super hard for the product to barely go away if at all Im super disappointed because I thought this was gonna be a gentle way of removing my masks but its even more abrasive than just removing them with a damp cloth and for awful results too So I would definitely recommend if you need a mask spatula but honestly just forget about the brush thing on the other end and remove your mask with water and a damp cloth or your hands , I use this for a totally different purpose to scoop and apply moisturizer to my face in order to avoid putting my fingers directly into jars I only use the spatula end as I have no use for the other side However it does work well for getting product out in addition to face application , love this mask applicator Helps explotiate my skin and makes application so much easier , I just bought this and have used it a few times and have enjoyed it Here are my thoughtsProsit has a scrubber side that helps breakdown and remove clay masks its pretty gentle from my experienceits a small tool and is easy to store with your masksit has a decent size spatula to apply your face masksit makes the whole face mask process more hygienic you dont need to use your fingersits easy to clean after usePotential Consthe spatula may be too wide for some peoples preference which may make application around the nose difficultI like this as I like that I dont need to dip my finger into my mask jarsmake a mess with my hands I also find that the scrubby side is really helpful when trying to remove something like a clay mask The large spatula is something I just work around by rotating and angling the tool strategically to fit the contours Is this a must have Maybe not for everyone I mean you can apply and remove a face mask with your hands for free But it really depends on what you want this tool for and how you prefer to applyremove masks IMO its a decent price and assuming it lasts forever Im not mad at it , Perfect to apply and remove clay or mud masks No longer have product wasted on my fingers or a brush I use the angled end to get around my nose The scrubber does a good job removing the product and its easy to stay hygienic Recommend , I dont know why the reviews are so bad for this I have the pink version and I love it Is it great at applying masks No  the spatula end is decent for cream and gellike masks but it is a bit too big to place product around the nose However I love using it for scooping and mixing face or hair masks or applying spot treatments so I dont have to use my fingers The scrubby side is great for breaking up mud masks and goopy masks that dry up on your face I honestly use this several times a week and its just a handy little tool to have in my skincare drawer , Loved it Perfect for mud mask and I no longer have to ruin rags and product when doing a mask , Loved it Best tool to use for applying and removing clay masks , This spatula is HUGE its literally the size of a large spoon but thick and heavy  I like tools like this but for me it was just too big especially to be a face mask applicator  The size of the side that is used to remove the face masks kind of makes sense but I feel like the other size doesnt make holding it ideal  I have some great skin cleansing tools and was looking for a way to apply masks but Ill just stick to using my hands  This is super clunky etc and I do not recommend just use your hands , Works as intended and easy to clean Has come in really handy with messy masks , Bigger than I thought it would be but is super easy to apply on face and easy to clean afterwards It could have used a smaller application end for the nose and around eye areas but overall pretty easy to use , Not a good mask applicator hard to put mask around nose area when using this  Going to stick with the  brush I have been using , I wanted to get this as a replacement for the brush I use to apply face masks because I always felt like I was wasting product in the brush the silicone head makes it hard to get an even thin layer and is especially hard around the nose The other end also doesnt really help the removal process Ive found myself returning to the brush instead of using this"
Face Serum,"Makes my face super smooth and its not thick or sticky I love it so far , 4 weeks in skin is much bettersmootherremoved small bumpssmaller pores acne scars are fadingI was scared bcs Im oily skin who breaks out and I never had a pimple since using this product The pump is fine it is watery but me personally I dont have a problem with that it still works just as great and it dries fast , My pump wont get any product out no matter what I do The product itself is fine but its nothing outstanding , The pump on the serum broke immediately and failed to get any product out whatsoever The serum also did not smell very pleasant Overall would not recommend purchasing , It took a while of using this product to see a difference It helped to get rid of some blackheads that had been there for a really long time I also used red light separate from this product , Maybe brightened my face a bit Not bad for the price  , DislikesRunny formula SplattersPump sticksLikesPlump skinReduced acne scarsSmoothes texture , Kinda too runny for me personally and was actually really disappointed upon receiving it The product wasnt even completely full like a good amount was not filled up Sighhhh , Overall the serum is great The pump gets stuck resulting in the serum splattering everywhere when it comes out the bottle , Oh man this stuff is a flop  The pump alone is a mess it just squirts and lands everywhere  The serum itself is super runny and thin  Hard pass for me , Jai ador ce produit je lai maintenant termin et je vais en acheter un autre , The way it squirts out gets everywhere and really liquidity , Its very difficult to find a product that doesnt contain hyaluronic acid so when I saw that it didnt I bought 2 of them However I did not notice that it contained sodium hydroxide and alcohol Im not a chemist but I do realize that you need a stabilizer but isnt that what propanediol for This also contains sodium benozoate which is a preservative so why does this need to have lye and alcohol in it , the pump did not work but was an ok protuct if you have dull skin it is good and glowy , I like it Goes on easily and dries fast Smells OK nothing special , Im an ingredient nerd and Im not impressed by its Also its super runny should just be a spray , Ive been using this serum for over 2 weeks now and I will say so far so good It really helps me with my acne I just dont really like the smell of it but its a great product , the bottle was really small and the pump was broken not sticky not very hydrating but all in all I will still use it it really deserves 3 stars , This is surprisingly one of the best face serums I have ever had It looks weird and smells funny and given the price I never expected much but it after a short while of regular use I feel my skin is quite hydrated that no one believes I had a very dry skinIf you have dry skin I recommend you to give this weird thing a chance , very smooth light weight  primer  i am using this as primer before foundation and it smoothes my skin and really love to apply this , i loved this so much perfect for any type of skin , I dont know what it is but I didnt like it It felt like something Id buy for my little sister to play pretend There are soooo many face serums so this one can go sit in the back Honestly I threw it in the trash after trying it several weeks It just felt too waterya little sticky and like a placebo product or 8 yr olds play product , Light fresh smell  hydrating as well No issues with pump , Absorbs easily and is lightly scented  I did feel my skin looked clearer when using it  The pump was annoying though , I love this product I use it at night on a regular basis I add it in to my evening routine , The hemp one is great especially for the price Yes the pump is demonic but if you just cup your hand when you use it it doesnt go everywhere I feel like my somewhat breakoutprone skin is calmer and clearer since using this Might not be for everyone but Im repurchasing , Lychee is a lovely affordable hydrating serum This is a 5 serum its not going to change your life but I enjoyed using it and felt it was very hydrating , I like it Moisturizes well Smells a little weird but nothing concerning lol , Horrible sticky terrible pump no results no anything pills up sucks under makeup Its super cute Ill give it that I bought it to get my beauty reward samples lol wasnt worth even the five dollars  May be fun for a young teen wanting to try skincare , using this serum from 2 weeks and happy to see the results totally recommend this product , Weird smell the closest thing I can compare it to is celery Stains your shirts Thankfully I was only using it at night and can bleach the pj tops Threw it away after a couple weeks and I hate to waste anything , The bottle was spilled all over the bag when I received it Called customer service which was great and they sent a free replacement I receive the second bottle unopened but the pump doesnt work at all I dont like the dropper types and was really hoping this one would be great but now I have to open and pour on my hand to use Might sound silly but if it has a pump it should work The hemp smell is also very strong , Press down on the pump and it shoots out all over the place  Best bet is to cup it in your hand to dispense product Good LordTalk about a mess right in front of yourself or more like flying across the room Otherwise like the serum product for heat and humidity weather that were having right now , Anything that I get from Sephora I do find is very good however this was one of those hohum items Would I buy it again probably not the pump got stuck a few times I wasnt too keen on the smell Although I do find it is lasting a long time and I do use it every day So maybe I am too quick to jump the gun to say I will never buy it again , This stuff has worked wonders on my skin If I ever have a breakout or a dark spot this stuff really works over night depending on how deep the pimple or scar is it has never burned my skin even if I use it every night and I always wake up with my skin feeling brighter and tighter  Great for spot treatment or the whole face I really want to try the other products like this Ive been using this since last year January 2021 and it is now June 2022 My skin looks so much more healthy The first bottle I got was a free sample and I was scared to try it but then one day I get a pimple and nothing would work so I tried it and it was gone over night  I barely ran out of my first free bottle so I bought another  Dont hesitate just buy it  , The serum was really watery and the spray applicator was super bad It would spray out too much and squirt all over Not bad for the sale price though , Best Stuff Ever No idea what kind of hoodoo they used but this is an amazing serum It makes me look alive , Smells good but doesnt do anything for the skin and the package was horrible , Heard it smelt bad and by the Color and everything I also thought it was going to smell bad but in fact it doesnt smell bad at all I quite like this product , I opened it and it smelled like nail polish it was horrible I wouldnt use this on my face The pump was broken on both of the ones I got The only good thing is that I was refunded for the 2  I bought Customer service was wonderful and helpful , Would not recommend  I didnt like it for the fact that i couldnt tell it made any difference on my skin  I used the entire bottle before i wrote the review  However it does go on fairly well application is easy  It did not make me breakout and saw no blemish redness at all , this felt sticky on my skin I guess others have liked it  but I would not purchase for myself again and I wouldnt go out of my way to recommend it either , Sorry Sephora Was excited to try this little mushroom face serum but hard to when the pump doesnt work AT ALL No damage to the bottle the pump is clearly just faulty Only way to use is to open bottle dip tube in and dab on fingers Not very sanitary and the liquid is light so not very effective , Lightweight and I love the results Very affordable and not harsh for my sensitive skin , I bought this because everyone has been talking about serums and I am so surprised how much I like it It totally calms down anything I have going on with my skin and I barely have to use moisturizer Normally I have dry sensitive skin , I really love the hemp serum I bought it initially as a gift for my little one for Christmas I had a really discomforting blemish a while back and she brought it for me to use with one application before bed it was virtually gone No discomfort anymore I had to buy myself one Its really cheap and great for spot treatment I think its under hyped , Despite other reviews I actually really like this I love the scent and when I used it in combination of my facial cleanser my skin was great and it continued to look great through the whole day It balanced out my tone and the makeup application afterwards was flawless I have learned from my last purchase of a different serum but same brand that the pumps are useless I just unscrew it and use the tube as an applicator Will be buying again , Like most other reviews say the pump does not work at all I ended up just unscrewing the cap and using it that way It does feel nice and is of a watery consistency But hard to use though and its tiny but thats what you get for the price , Stuff will shoot out across the room Leaves my face sticky no benefits , These serums were really meh They didnt really do much except feel hydrating I think for the price they were fun but you can get better hydrating and barrier repair serums that do more for your skin , Really feels like its hydrating my face only issue is it gets everywhere The spray is completely unpredictable and it will splash back onto my hand or arm , Feels great But the pump makes the product come out to hard and it goes everywhere I read about that in other reviews but I thought maybe it was just themnopeits me too , Its very cute and works well with my face its about 2 12 inches so it is a little smaller than I expected still great tho , I love it  I also gave my daughter a skin care treatment and used this after and she loved it , Ive only had this product a few days so I havent used it enough to see any results yet The mushroom one smells awesome It doesnt leave a sticky residue after it absorbs The packaging however is terrible It took at least 20 pumps to even get it started The shape of the pump is so awkward too Its almost rounded at the top so its difficult to grip and totally uncomfortable to use I wouldnt buy again but Im not super disappointed being that I got this item on sale , Smells really artificial the whole packaging was faulty and it leaked everywhere in my skincare drawer so I barely got to use any of it , Im not sure how well it works as it didnt make a huge difference What I will say is that the pump on this bottle is crazy and not in a good way It takes a lot of force to get it to go down at all then the product shoots out messily , Will break you out Even if its on sale not worth it , I really love how nourishing it is on my skin It has a really nice feel to it too and it lasts quite a while surprisingly If you dont have a moisturizer or you need a cheap substitute this would be the one It makes me feel really good I just dont like how small it is for the price I paid , The pump is cheap and hard to use It is not a goos shape to control where is squirts Your finger tends to slide off half way through pressing it Using two hands helps but then you still dont have control over how much comes out or where it goes Even if I squirt it directly on my face it still ends up everywhereThe product is pretty good It had helped with clearing up my skin I still wouldnt recommend it because it isnt anything worth putting up with the packaging , Despite the reviews I gave it a shot since it was on sale I actually quite liked it It did give my skin a nice glow even from beneath my foundation I found it more effective to dab it only slightly on my cheeks and temples 4 stars only because it dispenses a hefty amount that you dont necessarily need for application , I like a lot of Sephora skin care products but this aint it sis It was sticky and felt uncomfortable on my skin You can get a way better product for the same price at Walgreens , Let me start off by saying the product itself is okay Not exceptional but its fine The problem comes from the dispenser bottle It squirts out haphazardly in EVERY direction I thought I could manage this by cupping my hand around the pumpuntil today when this GRAPEFRUIT serum squirted THROUGH MY FINGERS and DRENCHED MY EYE from a gentle pump nearly 2ft away I flushed my eye but its still tingling Please avoid this If you must buy it switch it to a different dispenser , Lets start with the pump Its faulty and sticks so you never know how much product will come out So difficult to use The product itself is sticky I could probably accomplish the same thing rubbing a grapefruit directly on my face Sure theres a slight glow but you have to ensure feeling sticky and its just not worth it , The pump is Terrible Just a waste of product Im returning , I like the product because I consider myself to have dry skin and I felt my skin more hydrated and betterlooking than before but I would feel like I needed to use two sprays for the morning and two for nighttime and I realized my product was running out So I limit myself to one I do have to say the product is small but it did help me and I got it on discount , Worst pump that could ever be chosen for a serum its spewing the product like house cleaning spray with no way to make it softer Product in itself is fine but Id recommend you rather invest in another brand , Amazing must have My skin is glowing like never before so not need any make up Best Buy for a great price , Good product Did not dry out my face like others have stated However the pump is hard to pump and liquid is thin so it has potential to make a mess if you arent careful Since I read the reviews first I did not have any problems or make a mess I bought this because it was in sale but it didnt do anything special for me so I most likely will not be purchasing again Maybe it is a great product for you It is definitely worth a try , It has a nice sweet scent and felt very light on my skin The pump was a joke though because its hard to use and the serum blasts out Im planning to use the serum for a compressed face mask so Ill see how that goes , I have some annoying combination skin with some usual nose rosacea flares up from time to time struggling to find a product that my skin can tolerate and this was surprisingly it Seems gentle and makes my skin quenched I love it  , Its very hydrating but the pump didnt wanted to work like it does pump product out but very little but overall the serum is nice feeling on the skin didnt break me ou its very good , I LOVE the lychee serum I have been using it consistently for a week and Ive noticed that my fine lines are more subtleI also like the mushroom serum It makes my skin look SUPER glowy and fresh If you have oily skin Id avoid using itThe only downside of this product is the pump It is AWFUL I hope you guys fix the pump because this is a fantastic product , For those wondering what kind of mushroom it is Chaga Mushroom , I have rosacea and it was not the right product for my skin type , Like many of the review say the packaging for this is not good The pump is hard to push down so you end up doing it too hard  getting the product all over I usually cup my hand to avoid wasting any product This serum itself is so good I really hope they just change the packaging but keep the product itself It is very light  doesnt leave my skin feeling too weighed down I have acne prone dry skin  I love it , Some others didnt like the smell I have sensitive skin and that was no issue I personally did not notice it Its shoots everywhere but other than that I enjoy it , I love this product but if you already have dry skin it might not be for you I tend to have very oily skin and it dryer my skin but not too much I dont know if it necessarily helped with blemishes but it did make my pores shrink and skin look healthier , this stuff along with my other face products has made my skin SO glowing , It helps in fighting acen which i didnt expect from it and controls oil living my skin feeling good , It seems like good serum but I havent been able to enjoy its benefits My skin is really dehydrated and dry When I use this product it feels like it quenches the thirst of my skin as it gets absorbed well and its not overly stickyUnfortunately I find myself not reaching for this serum because it is such a hassle to use Its like the dispensing pump has its own mind  it ramdomly decides when its gonna work which is like after pumping 10x or more and if its working the liquid just flies around everywhere so a lot of product loss Its really annoying I guess you get what your paid for which is a shame because it seems like it could really be a good product I hope they eventually change the packaging but I guess it wont be this cheap then Anyway I wont bother repurchase this , You have to push the pump super hard to get any product out Half the time it gets everywhere but in my hand Horrible packaging , I love it I use this every night Hold the pump into the palm of your hand cup your hand a little and push pump slowly and steadily This will stop it from spurting everywhere  Feels nice on my skin , I honestly dont completely know what this does but it makes my moisturizers go on so much smoother and feels great on the skin It does have a mild mushroom scent which is odd but not unpleasant feels like Alice in Wonderlands skincare and is very very watery more of an essence then a serum Alright enough and I enjoy using it but it doesnt seem to have much of a long term effect I can notice it just makes everything feel better on the skin which for 4 dollars is worth it in my opinion , For 5 bucks I wanted to give this serum a try The serum is lightweight and has a nice scentit does the job well My one complaint is the Container dispenser The pump is hard to work with to dispense the proper amount of serum I ended up dispensing too much serum , i got the lychee one like all the other comments the pump does suck it will splash out of your hand and go everywhere but it also has a lot of fragrance and when i mean a lot its 9 on the list out of 18 i believe if i counted currently and also contains alcohol i havent noticed a change in my skin so far but if youre actually looking for something to change your skin go to the inkey list i just found their cleanser and it transformed my face , I bought the mushroom serum only because I needed to spend a few more dollars to get a free sample wasnt really looking for anything specific so at 5 I figured might as well give it a try kinda blew my mind how nice this is especially for that price My skin is already dry and the winter weather is killing me and this little guy really helped with hydration and with the dry flaky skin And I feel like its helping take down redness on my cheeks a lil bit as well The pump does kinda suck like others have said you just have to cup your hand around it to prevent it from going everywhere Id actually buy this again not bad at all , Feels great on the Skin Skin feels soft after application not greasy and absorbs quickly Only dissapointment is the dispenser pump Have to be careful when pressing it , trop bon produit je suis trop heureuse je le recommande beaucouo beaucoup , Great serum but the pump is terrible Wish it dispensed differently it ends up spraying the product all over the place , I am surprised this product is not popular Its amazing When I bought this I wasnt expecting much from it It was an inexpensive product and thought I would just try it out But it shows results after just one use I apply it at night and in the morning my skin is very smooth and porcelain like I have a very dry and textured skin and I was pleasantly surprised at the results I have only been using it for 4 days so I cannot comment on the antiblemish claim but it definitely firms up the skin and makes it smooth I absolutely love this As mentioned in other reviews the pump is not that smooth It squirts out the serum However after using it a couple of times you get used to it and learn to work with it Honestly at this price point it doesnt matter to me at all I will probably update once I finish the bottle and see if blemishes have reduced I not surprised to see this out of stock but I hope Sephora restocks it soon and keeps the price low , I wanted to like this serum Unfortunately it is too watery and didnt really hydrate very well Also the little spray bottle it comes in is defective and didnt spray well I usually do well with Sephora products but this was a miss , Smells nice but didnt see a big difference in my skin with itthe bottle is also not great squirts everywhere and makes a mess , Easy to apply only takes a small amount and very effective , Really good I have the Lychee and Grapefruit version Both are just basic serums that I layer under my other skincare I havent seen any drastic improvements with my skin but for the price they are getting me by until I can save enough for my high end serum that is 48 The Lychee is my favorite but the Grapefruit gives my skin a nice healthy glow I havent experienced any irritation or breakoutsand my skin is VERY acne prone The pump sucks and could definitely be improved But otherwise I like this product , Not good I got acne after using two days of this serum , Really hard to pump out at first the pump is hard to use basically squirts far away if not careful Smells a bit like cardboard but nicer Ive used it for a week but there isnt too much result perhaps the skin got more nourished , HiI got 2 pimples overnight on my face after using this serumI bought the hempnight green one , Works like magic on me I can see a noticeable difference on my skin the next day Just ordered more the bottle is not easy to handle but the serum is worth it , Ordered and received half empty Im very upset Seriously Sephora And Im too busy to be going and shipping it to return it , This is lightweight formula and has a very mild fragrance but the bottle is problematic I couldnt notice any difference in my skin either , Liquidy Not full bottle Would not recommend It is a tiny bottle and yet not even full , I truly love this product I was little bit septic about the smell but it smells like earth I dont know how to explain hahaha I ordered to use it with my gua sha but the texture is really watery and it gets absorbed but the skin fast All in all I love it even tho I cant use it with my gua sha , The serum seems to work as described but the pumppackaging is awful Definitely worth the cheap price , This is one of the best skincare product I have come across Sephora collection I was very spectical at first not knowing what will be or will make any difference to my skin I grabbed it with it was on sale  I got the LYCHEE one which was hydrating one I use this as hyaluronic acid It had actually replaced my and other hydrating acid  This simple did the work I have very dry and sensetive skin But the fragrance somehow didnt bother my skin It helps any moisturizer you put on top work much better Dry skin out there give it a tryNot giving total 5 star because of it pump its awful First time I pumped it was everywhere except my palmBut I usually unscrew the cap and put it into my palm The bottle itself is so small  dont have worry about over pouringAnd also the whole oz container is very smallThe picture doesnt do justification on his small this product it , It smelt nice but mine didnt come full The pump is sealed off but you can still twist it open Also Im not sure what the consistency is supposed to be but mine is like water 2 stars for the smell , I gave four stars because product is good and working making my face shine and skin glow and smooth But bottle is plastic and pump is not working whenever you do to make it work Lucky I saved another bottle from other brand serum so I poured it in that free bottle and enjoy of the good quality 30 ml grapefruit serum on sale , The hemp serum has totally turned my skin around in just 3 nights Its been so great for my skin that Im more than willing to look past the shoddy packaging The pump is truly horrible but what can you expect for such a low price , I ordered this in early August for my boyfriend He has sensitive skin and has to wear a mask for workhe works in a hospital so every night when he comes home his skin is red and cheeks covered in a rash When he asked me to help find something for him I did a deep three week search for the perfect thing that would work but also be wallet friendly I found this and thought it wouldnt be bad to try since its such a great price and says it helps with redness Ordered it got it the two days he used it and loves it As soon as I put it on my face the redness went down SO MUCH It smells good too and helps the oil on my face Boyfriend I will definitely buy it again and recommend it for anyone who deals with redness and sensitive skin , Thin serum but still felt hydrating The pump worked fine for me and the smell is earthy but not offensive in my opinion , Bottle so small I got 3 of them and there really small not worth the price at all , It gave me an instant glow and I feel like its gradually improving my dark spots Yes the pump and bottle suck but I just transferred the serum into a glass bottle with a dropper Its an amazing product for the price point , Lychee Serum smells really nice Dont know if its doing anything but its lovely to smell in the morning when I apply it The packaging isnt the best quality  tends to shoot out and is very watery , TLDR very worth it for the price but keep the price point in mind when it comes to packaging if youre picky about that I Love the mushroom serum very gentle so it never burns or irritates my skin and it has definitely made my skin brighter over the last 2 weeks or so Ive been using it I dont notice any off putting smell either almost scent free to me Sticky for a few minutes but once it absorbs into the skin theres no strange residue or feeling left behind I understand why some people who are super picky would be bothered by the pump but its really not that hard to face the tip into your palm and then use it by rubbing your palms together and pressing it into the skin Yes its a bit small but the mlfluid ounces are listed on the website and its only 5 with the sale so it wont be huge I only need a pump or two to cover my whole face so after a little over 2 weeks Im not even close to half way through it Thin but still has a good serum consistency Definitely will repurchase if its still in stock when Im out , Has an odd smell but not the worst thing ever Clean serum which is a plus , The top makes a crack sound when you pop it Yes you have to push down hard I thought I was going to break it But I was able to get it to release the pump As for the product it does work good Leaves my skin feeing dewy throughout my day I use this daily on bare cleaned skin I dont understand the poor reviews Id buy again and Ill try the other formulas , The biggest issue is packaging the pump really does not work well at all The product inside the package would get 4 stars but a better pump is really needed For the price though I would probably buy again , It seems like a nice product but it made me breakout I do not have a sensitive skin so I dont know why , Feels like washable after use smells like face wash not serum , I actually love this Mushroom got it on sale great product for the price My skin feels wonderful , Works lovely Put it in my spf lotion and created a nice tan , I use it every morning after toning and I feel that my face feels smooth , It came good in the packaging its thicker than a face oil I dont really  see a difference after using it for a while it just makes my face feel clean and refreshed , I liked the serum its perfect for a light summer primer especially if your face tends to feel heavy or overheated during summer sweat the smell is okay like a natural earthy melon sweet smell its got a somewhat cooling feel which I like but my biggest complaint Is the components pump it pumps out too much which is product waste but worse is it SPLASHES you everywhere on your hand and maybe more its an out of control pump pumps out too much too fast with little pressure but I kept my rating a 4 because value of the product and they give you enough for that 5 office point to kinda make up for it and and quality is pretty good mix this with st Ives yes budget otc beauty glowing moisturizing cream and youve got a glow recipe dupe for their melon moisturizer and for much less so I had more good to say than bad but I tried to be honest the pump needs work but then I imagine the price will reflect that so be grateful gals its worth it Im likely going to eventually try out a few of the other formulas , This moisturizer is the BOMB Super concentrated I only needed two pumps for my entire face and neck Its also got a bit of a watery consistency which is nice because it almost instantly absorbs into my skin without leaving any film or residue behind My skin feels so soft and has a healthy glow after using this product Will absolutely buy it again , I usually have good luck with the Sephora brand items Not this It was runny clumpyjust gross I tried to use it several times before I finally just tossed it , I absolutely love this product It actually works on slowly but surely getting all my age spots blemishes off my face Although yes the pump mechanism could be better I could care less about the container I care about the actual product and I love it so very much , Love really helps your skin look smoothe with less lines , Completely Meh perf"
Facial Cleansing Tool,"Obsessed Have been using this for 6 months and it really has become such a staple of my skincare Love it , Its not a bad tool I just feel like I can get the same level of clean with my hands , I love this little thing It is an amazing exfoliator effective yet incredibly gentle I use it in combination with Korres Greek Yoghurt Foaming Cream Cleanser also a great product and it not only gets my face beautifully clean but also leaves my skin incredibly soft Since I started using this tool I have reduced my use of Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Daily Peel wipes from every other day to about once every 710 days which is a huge  saver , I dig this so far Ive used it for about a week and everytime I have my face looks and feels way cleaner but not overly worked Product stays well on it too for emulsifing Pores looked clean , its not a necessity but it works and for that Ill give it a good rating , This is a very nice facial cleansing tool it is so soft but it does the job well I like it a lot , After reading the reviews I decided to give this inexpensive tool a try After using it for months I can say that its not a necessary tool in my daily regiment I can clean my face just as well without it So do I still use it Yes I keep it in my shower and use it from time to time Does it feel pleasant on my face Yes Has it in any way helped improve the texture of my skin No Does it exfoliate my skin No the bristles are too soft for any exfoliating Does it clean my face well Yes but I can accomplish the same result just using the palms of my hands , Was honestly wowd by this little gadget So simple and  easy to use yet effective while still being gentle on your skin Glad I decided to try it out , After using this product for about a week and a half I can already feel my face feeling more cleansed than just using my hands to wash my face , I have two nose piercings on each side of my nose I used to hate cleansing my face because of this until I used this I genuinely just go over my piercings with this and it does not hurt at all You cant feel it It is so soft And gets the job done A real life changer for people with face piercings , Im so glad I found this scrubber  The price was great thanks Sephora sale its just the right size and has been exactly what I needed during these last few months when the heated winter air inside is dry and my skin can be prone to flakiness  Applying a small amount of cleanser on this scrubber gets my face incredibly clean and refreshed  cant recommend it strongly enough , I really enjoy this facial scrubby I always use my clarisonic to wash my face but like something like this to remove makeup with balms or to wash off masks but Ive been enjoying this so much that Ive been reaching for it over my clarisonic at times , Its smaller than the palm of your hand but it gives your face extra exfoliation while still gentle with your favorite cleanser Very durable and easy to get into areas like the corners of your nose , Ive only been using this tool for about a week and after just a day two my face feels fantastic  Ive always cleansed my face twice a day but since using this Facial Cleansing Tool my face feels so smooth  I keep touching my face because it feels so great , Makes washing my face much more effective at getting it clean I also love that the silicone is easy to keep bacteria free , Its so soft but really helps make my face more supple after using with my cleanser because it can gently exfoliate , This works so well that I ended up buying additional ones for my family A little cleanser goes a long way on this and it provides just enough exfoliation to really get in and clean out junk and makeup Absolutely worth the 8 , simple and effective totally buy this instead of the foreo products so much cheaper and does the same thing , Really nice for washing my face  I bought another brand but didnt like it as much so repurchased this  This is soft on the face , Get it For real its so easy to use a face cleansing tool should be easy to keep clean and soft Since using this little thing I am not rough on my skin when washing Its so soft yet allows me to cleanse my skin thorough Hint I squeeze my cleanser on it first focused on the area near the tip and then run it quickly under the water Just try it Ill buy this as long as they continue to sell it , I feel like its way better and less messier than using my hands and its different shapes get in the corners where my make up gets and massages my skin at the same time I love it , Feels really gentle at first Cleans surprisingly well though Really gets in there , I love this cleansing tool My face feels so clean after using compared to when I was using cotton rounds and Michelle water Now I use this tool with the Cerave foam cleanser I have noticed less breakouts after using this tool as well , love it so soft it has helped me clean my skin so much , Love this  soft soft on the face and yet gets the job done  my menopause skin has been dry and peeling and this has been a god send to help clean up the texture that I have never had until menopause  , I use this all the time now This just became part of my daily skin care routine I definitely feel like it helps when Im washing my face for a more deeper cleanse , Loving this product Grabbed it during the Sephora sale and am pleasantly surprised It is an amazing tool to use when removing makeup and washing your face , Effective yet gentle enough for my VERY sensitive skin , Creates a lot of lather and helps my face wash go further Definitely saves money and feels amazing on my skin , Love this product Before using this washing my face was NOT my favorite thing to do dont ask me why we all have our things Now I cant wait for the extra clean feeling this provides not to mention the mini massage and gentle exfoliation all without breaking the bank And just a dab of product will do it If youre on the fence just put it in your cart you wont regret it , I rarely feel compelled to write a review butjust buy it For the price you cant beat what this does I was shocked how much lather it created from my cleanser and how gentle it is Makes me feel like my face has been dirty only washing with my hands Skin was immediately smooth and glowing Saw difference in texture and pores after one use , Makes washing your face super easy and enjoyable My skin feels super clean after using this , This product is worthy every penny I have been using it for over two months and noticed how much my skin has improved although I didnt change my skincare products Really good stuff , I LOVE this I was expected stiffer bristles but these are so soft and my face is incredibly smooth after cleansing Will buy again , Love this so much I feel like it really helps with getting all the dirtsweat off when washing my face , I use it with a cleanser or micellar water to get make up off my face gently Best thing I ever bought Easy to clean as well , Skin feels great easy to clean So please sales person recommened , There is so many uses for this cleansing tool I use it to get an extra scrub on my face with cleanser after wearing make up but also use it to wash my brushes especially when travelling Its small but portable and cleans everything very well Highly recommend , This facial cleaning tool is amazing I have very dry skin and often have dry patches on my face I use my exfoliating cleanser once a week so Im often stuck with the dry patches until I exfoliate next But I started using this a little over a week ago and Ive noticed a huge improvement in my skin texture I use it morning and night with my regular facial cleanser and not only does it help with dry patches but the texture around my nose where my pores are is so much smoother I was worried that it would be harsh on my skin with daily use but I havent found that to be an issue Definitely a must try , This is the BEST cleansing tool Gentle on skin and gently cleans and exfoliates My 1 go to My skin feels so clean and fresh after use , pretty decent tool for the price point this is the first cleansing tool Ive ever used so i havent much to compare it to but it does the job and overall im happy with it though i dont think its a necessary addition to a cleansing routine , Im so glad I purchased this Its totally a game changer when you cleanse because it acts like an exfoliant as well My face feels so smooth after Since I have sensitive skin I probably wont use a scrub the same day as this little tool but this is great to couple with my cleanser , I love it Does the job its supposed to  soft enough that it doesnt irritate my face but firm enough bristles that I feel my pores have gotten the scrub they need and deserve , Its really gentle on my face It creates a nice lather from my cleanser and leaves my skin feeling smooth and cleaner than it would with my fingers I definitely recommend , Best little tool I squirt my cleanser on it and clean my face every morning and night Leaves my face feeling well cleaned and extra smooth  I love it , I absolutely love this cleansing tool I have one for my PRO Makeup Kit and my personal travel bag  Ive gifted this to my brother and dad they love it I use it with any liquid cleanser and even my gentle exfoliators , Very easy to use and easy to clean It gets into corners on the nose Gentle but effective , For all the Asians who know this pad is like a little Salux for the face  I put water on my face and cleanser on the pad and it just glides over my face but gives a little extra gentle scrub , Excellent tool for daily face cleaning It does its purpose very well and a complement with Clarisonic brushWorth every  you will be pleasantly surprised , I just used this last night and I noticed a huge difference on my face Feels super clean yet gentle , This is my first try with a silicone scrubber  My old Clarisonic Mia is on its last leg and is honestly too harsh for my more sensitive and fragile older skin  I am thinking of investing in a vibrating silcone scrubber but wanted to try out an affordable manual version first As soft as these silicone bristles are I am shocked at how polished and soft my skin is after each use Its remarkable to get such results without abrading the skin with a bristle brush  my skin is so relieved  I havent decided how it is working for deep cleansing pores That may be where the vibrating version comes in  I CAN say that it is superior to just using my handsto wash with and I believe the gentle treatment is causing my skin to behave better generally , All Ive ever used is makeup wipes and my hands with a cleanser when it comes to cleaning my face I bought this and I can honestly tell a difference My face looks and feels cleaner after using this with my cleanser , Love this tool its a great addition to your skincare routine I use it with my cleansers and have definitely noticed the difference opposed to using your hands , Wow this facial cleansing tool is so convenient for every day use I have been completely ignoring my Foreo tool since I got this because of its effectiveness I use it in the shower and it works well , Super cheap  great clean I have one and I got one for my boyfriend We use them daily My pores look tighter and more clean A lot better than using your hands or a makeup wipe One of my favorite Sephora products , Gives a much better clean feeling than just your hands Amazing price , I was skeptical when I saw the tiny packaging But I fell in love at the first use  so soft and exfoliating at the same time  I find this also more hygienique than my fingers  , Best thing Ive bought from the Sephora brand I love this little tool I dont know why I didnt buy one sooner The bristles are ultra soft yet you can feel them help with exfoliation Keeps my pores clean when paired with my favorite cleanser It dries quickly and easily considering its a little rubber tool , I love this little thing  It gently removes excess dirt and dead skin cells from my face  I have tried several different facial cleansing brushes and this my favorite  I really like that it is small so it can easily go into a travel bag , Absolutely love this product feels nice on your face and I love it , Love this The bristles are the perfect size and really lather my face wash well I love how this is flexible enough to get into the crevices of my nose and also soft enough to not irritate my skin Ive been washing with this for about a week now and I can honestly say that my skin has been noticeably softer and it feels like my face is getting cleaner as opposed to using my hands or a washcloth Definitely a must have Really a great cleansing tool , Would you believe me if I said the main reason for buying this facial scrubbing tool was because the color matches with my bathroom decor Silly reason I know but I was looking to replace my old facial scrubber the round pink one that was also purchased from Sephora and this new one looked a lot more aesthetically pleasing Besides that the circumference of the scrubber seems bigger which in my opinion is a plus The texture of the silicone bristles are perfect not too stiff and not too soft The only negative is that it wouldnt stick to my shower wall no matter what I tried , Super easy to use and effective A simple but must have tool for your daily skincare routine , This thing is awesome I have very sensitive dry skin and hate the way vibrating face scrubbers feel on my nose This is nice and small the tip is great for around the nose the silicone bristles are super soft yet clean very VERY well Overall I think this product is a hidden gem My face feels extra clean and Ill be purchasing another one as a back up , Its a softer silicone but I really like it for makeup removal I think its helpful for that as it bends really easy and throughout for eye makeup , Poor design Not sure how this product has gods reviews lol , Ive been using this for a few nights and I really like the feeling it gives  it feels like my skin is really cleaned I live in quite a polluted city and I enjoy wearing makeup but have quite a lot of days where I feel like my skin isnt clean after cleansing This makes my enjoy washing my face more I do wish they could add a design for this to be easily stored I still really enjoy it regardless , Love this I love to take baths at night and this is the perfect thing while I sit in the tub to sit there and wash my face , Too small for the price I returned it and bought 2 Ina  pkg for 499 pkg from Target , Ive only used this tool for a week and my skin has already wildly improved I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser tool isnt too rough Ive used it day and night with my usual face cleanser and my skin has gone from bumpy to smooth I keep stroking my face in disbelief  its so smooth What My face has been bumpy since puberty hit almost two decades ago I am absolutely boggled Anyway the tool cleans easy and is able to get into the space around the edges of the nose with the pointy end Im not sure what the wider bumps on the rounded edge are for Absolutely worth the cost I will be buying another to keep in my travel bag and recommending this to all my friends I love it so much , So simple I wish I had gotten this ages ago I use so much less product and it really lathers I dont think Ive ever realized how much product a washcloth absorbs I also love how the shape lets me get into creases around my nose and eyes I do wish it were a little larger and it would be nice to have the option to purchase one a little firmer but otherwise Im very happy with my purchase , This is such a simple but effective face cleaner This works well to help exfoliate my sensitive skin without being over the top , I bought one for myself and my husband We both love them Very lightweight and it works with no issues I replaced my exfoliators with this , Was originally disappointed in the size but to be honest its actually perfect Instead of spending 40 every few weeks on a decent exfoliant I have this nifty little tool that does the same thing with my regular face wash Maybe seem a bit pricey for 8 but overall saves you money for sure , I really dont really like it It feels super cheap like something you find out of the dollar bin It has no business being as expensive as it is and I dont feel like Im getting much done when I use it No real traction you know Softer than a kittens paw I want something that feels a bit more scrubby , This is a great cleansing product I use it as part of my nightime skin care routine and it cleanses extremely well all the while being incredibly soft I have very sensitive skin but this tool is very soft , I have sensitive combination skin As I age I have become more devoted to skin care conscious of how my skin responds to products I was looking for a tool to provide a deep clean and this one does the trick It is easy to hold using the handle on the back and maneuvering it over the face is so easy The pointed tip is perfect for my nose and  surrounding area the rounded bottom has nodules that offer a deeper clean to my chin and forehead and the remaining nodules are perfect for the entire face and neck It distributes my cleanser evenly over my face and is gentle on my skin but offers a deep clean feeling leaving my skin free of product and soft The rubber needs to be thoroughly cleaned because product likes to remain in the nodules but that is my only negative for this item The case it comes in is perfect the insert is a holder to allow it to air dry and the plastic casing can be reused to keep the tool sanitary between uses This is a perfect alternative to the Luna if cost is a concern the vibration is not missed with this tool My products absorb so much better now versus my fingers and my sensitive skin is never irritated after each use , This was sold out every time I tried to purchase except for the last time and I am not disappointed This tool helps to gently exfoliate my harder to get blackheads on my nose and chin and I am happy I waited until it came back into stock , I feel this is a bit on the flimsy sideI thought it would harder like the pink one I have in order to get a deep clean I like the size and point for the hard to get places like around the nose but bends easily , This thing is amazing If youre doing any kind of peel or retinol treatment say hello to your new best friend Flakies peelies and other general uglies come away with gentle circular motions and NO SCRUBBING  no irritation , Bought it on a whim I wasnt really paying attention until I got to the register Its nothing special not great not terrible but definitely overpriced , I really do love this I use it for cleansing and exfoliating sometimes It makes my skin feel so much cleaner than using my fingers Would definitely recommend and for the price its worth it , I adore this product I feel like I get really gentle exfoliation while using gentle cleansers that dont have any exfoliation products in them as I try to keep my cleansers as gentle as possible I find that it also allows me to use less product , So gentle while still feeling slightly exfoliating I love it I put some cleanser on it and go around my face Has a nice little handle to hold onto at the back of it Works well to take off my makeup instead of a microfibre cloth , I get way more lather using my water based cleansers with this little guy for 11 bucks you cant really go wrong , The tool I didnt know I needed Soft and gentle Has a great shape to help me get into the the crease of my nose Face feels so soft after cleansing with this Love it , Expensive silicone tools are really pointless this is all you need I actually bought a second one after trying the first  one for sink and one for showertravel I use it all over face and neck and love to use it in my hairline where dryness sometimes forms The shape is a little awkward but maybe Im not using it correctly I do like the grip on the back its got a little handle like a phone grip , This is fantastic for getting into all of the hard to reach places where my make up might be and is so soft and gentle Really leaves my face feeling clean and fresh , This is a game changer It feels amazing on my skin and makes me look forward to washing my face  Easy to use and clean and inexpensive You need this , I get more out of my face wash now that I use this  Way more bubbles feels more effective than just washing with my hands , Love it Gets makeup off super easily and its simple to clean off after each use , Really like using this one it definitely feels more gentle compared to some of the other face cleansing accessories Ive used , I bought this in stores for 11 because I needed a facial cleanser but didnt want to spend a ridiculous amount of money for one This has the perfect shape for getting all around the face Definitely a good buy , The bristles on the grey to are fine than the previous pink one and the it can reach into the crevasses around the nose better also  This does a great job of lifting off any residue from makeup spf primers etc , Jadore  Sensation que la peau est vraiment propre on sens que a dloge bien les pores  , Loved it buying it again So soft and gives my skin a good gentle clean , On a whim I tossed this into my online cart and so glad I did I love it its so much better than any scrubbing cleanser I have ever used and makes my face feel smoother than them too its gentle and not abrasive at all if youre considering an expensive clairsonic or something try this first , This is a great gentle silicone cleansing tool I ordered it online during a sale and when it arrived and was smaller than I had expected About 3 inches about the length of my fingers It is made out of silicone is a thin teardrop flat surface with little tiny silicone knobs on it I get it wet and add my cleanser to it and then massage my face gently with it There is a little knob on the back that you can put between your fingers so you can hold it easily while youre using it It feels great on my skin I have sensitive skin and this does not hurt or damage my skin at all Because of it small size I think you could easily travel with us There is a small knob on the back where you can hold the toe between your fingers so it doesnt slip around when its wet Its easy to rinse off and dry too Overall this is much better than I was expecting and a great deal I originally found this when I was looking at a much more expensive hightech cleansing tool but the other device got so many complaints about having to use a phone app that I look for an alternative This is perfect , Really feels like Im exfoliating my skin without irritating it , I cant believe how awesome this completely no tech face cleaning tool is It is made of silicone so it dries very fast and you dont have to worry about bacteria growing on it The point is absolutely perfect around the nose and it is soft and gentle on the skin but does give mild exfoliation You can use with any cleanser I use with my daily mild cleanser and once a week with my physical exfoliate The price couldnt be better for how perfect this is Has a suction cup on the back also I love it so much I just bought a second one for travel"
Facial Cooling Wands,"Yes yes yes These are a game changer I even bring them when I travel I leave them in the fridge and use them on my bare skin when Im feeling puffy or I use them with my eye serum before bed Feels amazing , I immediately placed these in the fridge when I received them looking forward to my evening skincare routine  They did not disappoint  The shape is so perfect for all the contours of the face and neck  The liquid and glass was cold and slipped nicely with my serums against my skin  I especially appreciated the size of the spoon shape as it fit perfectly over my closed eyes like a lovely cooling eye mask  I wiped them down with alcohol wipes after returning them to the fridge in their box for next time  A real inexpensive way to pamper your skin , shattered immediately upon setting it down on a hard surface , Ive never had cooling wands before so I cant compare to other alternatives but these are so pretty and they feel so good on my face I put them in the fridge and they are cold enough to massage my face for a quite a while Only thing I will say is that I am very careful with them bc Im scared to drop them bc they feel a bit delicate"
Facial Razor Set,"Ive really enjoyed using this I love how nice my face looks and feels afterwards as well It makes my skin feel really soft I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone I definitely think Ill purchase another , Theyre not awful but theyre not the best razors out there , These are the perfect razor for us beginning dermaplane folks Easy to hold and control not too easy to accidentally cut , Works well can get about two uses per razorWish the blades were sharper as have to use over one area multiple times , Honestly some of the best face razors Ive ever used , these are a god send for the price theres no tugging the hair bc the blades are super sharp Ive bought some crappy ones from other places and was hesitant bc of some of the reviews but these are the best quality , Maybe I got a bad set but these barely took even pieces of peach fuzz off A complete waste of money Going to try returning , Very painful It feels like its pulling the hair Bad quality , Never had a facial shaver that worked so well Totally recommend buying it Worth the money , Love these they do a great job   Great price too , Ive repurchased these razors a few times Even at 12 theyre still fairly cheap and get the job done If kept well you can reuse the razer a few times before the blade becomes dull The razor can be cleaned wtoner rubbing alcohol witch hazel etc , I would use with a serum and not on dry skin Also would advise disposing each razor after each use as I do , This is a great product Very good quality and easy to use , This is a must have for peach fuzz Shaves unwanted hair effortlessly , There good they do what there supposed to doAnother must have in my routine  , Im really loving these I worked for a dermatologist for 10 years and am very familiar with dermaplaning practices Id say this is a great product for beginners especially if a spaderm isnt in your budget or of any interest The most important thing is the angle at which you hold the razor and not performing this too frequently overexfoliation is a def a thing Make sure youre always holding the razor at a 45degree angle against your skin Short downward strokes are the best way to go when youre dermaplaning at home after you cleanse and dry your face Keeping the skin taut and moving from top to bottom is the general rule of thumb Take it slow too and be conscious of the unique anglescurves of your face Dermaplaning is a very intuitive practice Id recommend only doing it every 3 to 4 weeks for optimal results Afterward avoid direct sun exposureextreme heat for a few days days dont use scrubs or other exfoliators for a week avoid chlorine on your face for a week apply serums moisturizers and sunscreen as usual , Il fais trs bien les lames sont pas trop coupantes et aprs usage ma peau est toute belle , These facial razors are a game changer  I love how sharp they are the colours and their effectiveness in cleaning up around the brows removing peach fuzz and moreI will say that being someone with sensitive and clear skin I find these razors work very well however there definitely can be some initial irritation and redness the day of I typically use one at night and follow up with a light sensitive skin friendly serum and cicaplast balm to soothe any irritation It worked very well Im interested to see how long they last and hold up over time before tossing , Good face razor makes skin smooth Be careful I took the clear lid off and almost cut my finger off But my face is smooth so whatever , Painful and scratches my skin or pulls out hairs instead of giving a nice close shave , Just purchased this set as I used to use a traditional 35 blade razor on my face and I TOTALLY NOTICE A DIFFERENCE Not only is my skin smooth peach fuzz and hair free I didnt get any razor bumps or irritation that usually follows from shaving I would definitely restock as I love the colours and grip  , These are quite weighty and do their job well shaving facial hairs For the price especially with 30 off during the sale its a really good deal , These are effective and feel safer and easier to use than the dermaplaning tool from Stacked Skincare that Ive used for years Definitely switching over to these form Sephora , I Have been using Sephora Braun razor blades for over a year They are no different than what you would get at a store like Walmart I got them because they were having points multiplier theres nothing wrong with them , Ive used regular leg shaving razors on my face and they made me break out in terrible acne and Ive tried those hyped up Tinkle razors and they didnt actually remove my peach fuzz so I was skeptical of the Sephora brand ones but the Sephora razors are amazing  These remove all of my peach fuzz and slough off any deaddry skin that I have on my face and do not break me out at all  You just have to be very careful with them and use the right pressure and angles or they can definitely cut into your skin , Love how easy these are to use I use these for my facial skincare routine and they dont disappoint , I had hoped that this product would be better at getting chin hairs  I think a razor is more for me , I needed a good razor for my face because all of the previous razors I tried wouldnt work I was shocked when I first tried it because it immediately got the peach fuzz off my face while being gental , I have bought face razors before and I liked them for their convenience This is my first time trying Sephora brand  I liked them even better than my previous brand Smooth finish no cuts or bumps I I use soW serum or , If you are thinking about getting these get them They are the easiest facial razors to use and my skin feels so soft afterwards Its also a great price for the pack you get , I bought this but gave 3 out of the 4 away I found that they really pulled on my hair instead of shaving it and the Blane was way too long to contour the angles of my face properly I thoughtthoughyit would be great for eyebrows but big NOPE , Works great and easily removes facial hair This helps exfoliate dead skin cells skincare to work better and makeup look more flawless If you have drysensitive skin use a facial oil before shaving Follow up with serum and moisturizer , I really like it make sure to put some alo vira  and then shave  , Bought these because of reviews and they hold up I was skeptical any of these kinds of things would work because the tweezerman ones suck , these are easy to use for peach fuzz Tip use  a gel cleanser on my skin so the blade glides without tugging and then I moisturize after to avoid any irritation , Use these on my cheeks and upper lip Definitely leaves skin feeling smooth Also apply moisturizer after using Does what it needs to do Super cute colors Nice if you hate replacing blades , Great for the price I use it once every two weeks to keep my skin soft smooth and clean Recommend for everyone The pack of razors lasts a long time , Love these facial razors They arrive and stay sharp and are a fraction of the cost of name brandother competitors I use them on my upper lip and chin with ease and they glide smooth on the skin , Ive tried other facial razors n they have been cheap or get tarnished quickly I have been using the Sephora razors going on 4 years and they are a hidden gem get rid of my peace fuzz like no other , Omg BUY NOW These were sold out forever and nothing else compares Works SO good and use it with Rose Oil , These are honestly so good for the price Id recommend using an oil with it the ordinary rose hip oil is what I used and they work perfect on the upper lip and eyebrow areas"
Feeling Groovy Yellow Jade Eye Massager Set,"Love this accidental splurge when waiting in the checkout line  After a long day its just nice to press these cool stones against my eyes and face just to relax  No one stone is exactly the same color pattern but I like that , I love to use these to apply my eye cream I also have started to use them on my cheeks and neck too So cooling and smooths the skin I dropped one in my sink and its still in perfect condition  Great deal for two And unlike a roller nothing to rust , I was so excited to try this Im so glad I bought them theyre the perfect shape to massage the eye area gently without needing to angle the stone in different directionsCooling effect helps eyes feel good love it"
Firming Day Moisturizer with Peptides,"I cannot recommend this It pills when you mix with other serums AND alone Lets not mention that when you apply I can oddly feel every texture  pore in my skin I wanted to like it since Im 46 and losing elasticity This was a good price point and on paper it was a good product but its not worth buying Im returning after a week of frustration , Unfortunately this moisturizer was not what I had hoped it would be I would definitely not recommend this as a morning product as it pills like crazy underneath any other product including sunscreen Its difficult to fully rub in and leaves a bit of a white cast Once its in its not a bad moisturizer but its not something that is easy to use and Im not sure if its firming in any way other than being stiff itself Id recommend trying another product , When putting the moisturizer on my face it didnt spread easily wasnt moisturizing and definitely not to be used under foundation It also felt  irritating on my face The day after using it my skin started breaking it , Ive only used this cream a few times  it does absolutely make my skin look younger  And it doesnt instantly sink in to my skin leaving it feeling dry an hour later  But its extremely thick and it doesnt blend well on the skin and pills  Ill try using less and if that doesnt work Ill try using it on top of thinner oiler moisturizers to see if they prevent this one from pilling  Maybe after playing around Ill find the sweet spot but not sure if Id buy this again even though its very affordableFor reference Im 49 with very dry skin and fine and deeper lines as well as skin sagging  this definitely addresses all three noticeably after only a few days  I dont look 20 lol but its definitely firming and tightening my skin at least while the product is on , I love Sephora brand skincare but this one is not good  My skin is not fussy its quite easy to take care of maybe just some dry patches once in a while aka my skin is not hard to impress This moisturiser is supposed to be for all skin types  extremely hydrating Yes indeed its thick but not thick like thick on your skin its thick in the jar You have to dig it out if anyone used Sephoras Leave in Conditioner for hair with Amino Acids it is similar consistency on your hands  Once you apply it to your skin it feels like it dries off within seconds frequently I forget that I already applied it and end up re apply it because it feels that dry It does not add shineYour skin will feel thirsty I usually purchase Fresh Origins or SkinFX but I am on a budget and I trust Sephora brand skin care  makeup so I bought this daily moisturiser I dont think its worth it Buy SkinFX and use less of it so it lasts you longer if youre on a budget like me VS buying something cheaper and needed more of it to feel like its doing something I love that it has no scent , Pros This moisturizer does not feel oily or leave me looking oily after applying Cons Thos moisturizer feels like it just sits on top of my skin and creates a film that pills on my face  I will not be repurchasing this , For the price this product is great I invest most of my skincare budget into serums and exfoliants so its great to have an affordable moisturizer to top it all off Its very moisturizing which keeps my skin soft all day long , Im sad to say this new daydream is such a disappointment I was IN LOVE with the firming peptide day cream that has since been discontinued and replaced with this formula its chunky and doesnt soak into the skin well the older formula was 1000 better Listen to your customers and bring it back , Very good day cream Very gentle and hydrating cream No particular smell Helps for healing my skin with acne scars Like squalane Very affordable  , I bought this day cream because its such a great value Ive always bought expensive name brand day cream and now that Ive found this I wont buy them any more This cream moisturizes beautifully and no greasy film , Its a great creamI love the light weight formula , Super moisturizing Great for dry skin morning and night Makeup goes on perfect over top of this cream , Pretty effective at making my skin smooth and reducing the depth of my fine lines The texture looked weird when I first used it but it isnt an issue the cream eventually melts in your skin in a minute The cream feels like playdough in the jar lol Matte finish My skin doesnt feel dry after use I have sensitive skin and got no irritation This cream has a smooth and soft texture when you rub it in It rubs in easily Pretty good for its price I couldnt find peptides in the ingredients or maybe it goes by a different name in the listIf this is causing your breakout please know that it takes 46 weeks for pimple to develop so the actual cause of your breakouts is most likely a habitproduct that you used a month ago Ive tried a bunch of sample moisturizers from other expensive brands and this 24 cream outperforms or is just as good as many of them imo Ive been using it daily for about 3 weeks and theres still a lot of product left in the jar , FRAGRANCE FREE FTW Yas thank you Sephora for listening to customers and start making your skincare fragrance free This makes the product safe even for people with sensitivity  this is perfection , the old formula is so much better it made my skin plump firm dewy and made it feel so hydrated while still being lightweight bring it back please , If youre like me and were hoping this would be similar to the discontinued Peptide day firming cream youll be disappointed This formula is thick chunky and just sits on the skin It has a filmy matte finish It also broke me out all over my face No firming effect at all Would make a fine hand cream but Im looking forward to returning it this weekend Sephora needs to stop chasing trending skincare and keep formulas that actually work"
Firming Eye Cream with Peptides,"Tried this on a whim and was shockingly surprised Eyes looked and felt fresher within the first few uses , I love there brand all there stuff is quality stuff there mascara is amazingThis eye cream is great only have had it about 2 weeks and  already see improvement , A great eye cream that is MUCH more reasonably priced than the other eye creams out there I would totally buy it again , I had high hopes for this after reading rave reviews that it was an underrated gem Unfortunately it just doesnt cut it for me Im mid 30s and a major concern is lines that have developed between my lids and brows Most eye creams will hydrate and soften them so theyre not noticeable and the area less droopy This doesnt Its also drier than most creams almost waxy and doesnt spread well If you have no concerns yet then it might be good for prevention , So far this product is doing a great job in keeping the areas around my eyes hydrated I apply this product 2x a day especially after using ice guasha at night I am looking forward seeing further results , THIS IS THE BEST I wanted something for under eye puffiness and dark coloration After doing some research peptides seemed to be the answer I have used this as a base under my eyes every day and every night for the last few weeks and I can tell a significant improvement I was looking for something that was priced fairly for quality product I also have very sensitive skin and am very hesitant about trying new products I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EYE CREAM There is a lot in the small container and it will last for a while I will be buying again and continuing to use , Ive been using this product consistently and I havent really noticed any differences in my skin generally but its nice to put on before my concealer I still have dark circles and dryness , used for a couple weeks and bothered my eyes immediately after I stopped using I no longer had stringy eye goop Definitely dont recommend this is the first eye cream to  cause this for me , Made the skin around my eyes dry itchy and red at the corners Not for sensitive skin unfortunately  , Great eye cream Super moisturizing and actually does firm , Not for sensitive skin My eyes had a resction using this eczemadry patch swollen itchy and very redafter using this Would not recommend for sensitive skin , Ive been using for over a month and have noticed a difference in the firmness of the skin around my eyes non irritating and while it is a small container it goes a long way , Ive tried many eye creamsserums and this is the best so far Doesnt break me out it firms sagging eyelid skin and as a bonus helps with my chronic dry eyes It cools my eyes caused by inflammation or my hypothyroid  Its great especially at this price point , Not sure what is great about this but I didnt like the consistency Not sure if its cream or what or maybe my house is too cold so that it didnt spread easily  Not sure but will not be buying again again , I love the consistency however it leaves a residue under my eye and has discoloured my skin yelloworange  I suppose my skin is too sensitive , We cant expect grand changes from an eye cream but with that said this is a great product Its whipped consistency makes it both moisturizing and lightweight Its not heavy or greasy so it goes well under makeup It lasted me almost 2 months using a thin layer twice daily , Great product  I wont go without it  I lost a lot of weight and my eyes are sallow because of it  I see a big difference after using this product and I dont look so tired all the time now  It looks alarmingly small when you get the container but it will last quite a while , A very hydrating eye cream Literally Love this eye cream under my makeup , I much prefer the previous formula Why change things that work Its not creamy like the last one but being thinner it does seem like it may last longer Well see , Ive been using the product for several weeks now and love it Not too heavy and moisturizes the eye area without any greasy effect Very reasonably priced Love it , Reu en chantillon jai beaucoup aim Lger mais hydratant Se compare avantageusement aux produits plus chers Hte que a revienne en stock , This is a really thick eye cream that absorbs well and has lasted me a whole year , Its an okay eye cream It absorbs into the skin nicely and doesnt leave a thick residue on the skin like a lot of plumpingfirming eye creams do but Im very sensitive to the way my products smell and this has a very weird metallic scent to it I havent really noticed any significant difference in my eye area after using it either I got it as a free sample but probably wont buy the full size product Honestly starting to think eye creams dont do anything at all Ive never found one that made any difference whatsoever , I got this as a sample with my order I will be purchasing the full size when it returns to stock What kind of magic is this I swear you can feel the firming Honestly my eyes look like I havent had 3 kids and years of sleepless nights Worth every cent , ooooh dreamy I always have really dry skin right above my cheekbones below my eyes and this fixed that If I tap that area now I can feel a bounce to the skin  I researched peptides and they help create a barrier for future daily stress and pollution so even if you dont see a difference which I do you should still consider this as a preventative Its white mousse like creamy texture Dense too so you probably wont go through it quickly Im pretty impressed , Love the consistency of this its so thick and buttery I wouldnt say I notice any difference whether I use it or dont tho im starting to believe eye creams are a scam lol , A must haveleaves a smoode coverage when applied in the evening or morning  Ive used it for 2 weeks now and I see improvement , love this eye cream the texture is what drew me into trying a small amount goes a long way and i can see this bottle lasting me months i do see a difference but may add the brightening mask as well to see a real difference overall , I was pleasantly surprised by this product to start off Im an eye serumeye cream addict and have tried everything inbetween the price points of 25300 and let me tell you this product right here is extremely luxurious without the heavy cream feel or insane scent that many companies enjoy putting in their products not enjoyable for us sensitive ladies With my experience I noticed the texture is more of a souffle soft and airy it absorbed beautifully with the tapping motions I always use I saw immediate brightening and a slight lifting affect and subtle depuffing Overall I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to update if I see more of a drastic change as I use it so far its a very delicate and luxurious product for the eyes gentle and soothing , The best eye cream Hands down I have very sensitive aging eyes This is one of the few eye creams that I can use with reaction and the only one so far that improves the creases Ive time NEVER STOP MAKING THIS , I was struggling with my concealer creasing under my eyes until I found this product It hydrates and firms my under eyes in a couple of uses I use morning and night Ive tried other more expensive eye creams and this one takes the cake Cant beat it for the price point , I am so genuinely shocked by how amazing this works Its great for my ULTRA sensitive skin leaves my eyes bright and hydrated I actually have friends and family saying I look more awake Which is never I nap all the time  This eye cream is definitely a keeper for sure Its lightweight non greasy tightens your skin without the feeling of tight and dry skin and overall amazing I rub little bits around my face as well before bed and I wake up looking so amazing So goodbye expensive eye creams this ones a winner , Was looking for an eye cream to help with wrinkles and fine lines without retinol After seeing the reviews and talking to Sephora employees I took a chance on this one First night of application I woke up to smoothed out lines around my eyes and no dry skin I didnt even recognize my skin Nourishing and true results Even without the sale price this value and resultsdriven product is totally worth it Save your money on those luxury creams and pick this up immediately , I replaced my Clinique all about eyes riche with this eye cream I like it much better It absorbs quickly leaves skin smooth not too thin or thick just right Under makeup too , Too thick Soft skin but not much else Much prefer Biossance , This cream is very lightweight feels very nice on the skin no complaints and a little goes a long way , I love the texture and the cream leaves my eyes moisturized i just LOVE it , Absolutely love this eye cream Actually moisturizing and I feel like it even reduced some dark circles as well Doesnt pill under make up and wears well all day Definitely buying again , Bought this on a whim and its amazing So soft  gentile  The skin all around my eyes just loves it And its affordable , This cream is no joke Its cold when you apply it and feels wonderful It works almost overnight I noticed a big difference in my under eye bags within a few days  they were gone The price is worth it and this has become a staple now , Absolutely love this eye cream Love the texture and consistency Def feels hydrating and expensive , This eye cream is incredible  It soaks in and theres no greasy feeling after  Makeup wears well on top as well  Does it prevent wrinkles  Who knows but it sure does feel nice so thats good enough for me , I can not stress how good this eye cream is I have dark circle  dry under eyes Ive tried every eye cream you can think of  nothing ever worked This Within a week I look more illuminated  hydrated I dont ever plan on changing this eye cream , Favourite eye cream by far Really blew my mind Its so soft and creamy refreshing and gentle "
Firming Night Cream with Peptides,"I love this night firming moisturizer    I faithfully use it every night  Specially at the side corners of my eyes  It is thick and absorbes well overnight  Not greasy and doesnt stain pillowcases   Specially if I have been outside in the wind or in a very dry environment  I slather it on the minute I take my makeup off , I have used this for months and love it My skin is ridiculously dry and this works great , I absolutely love this night cream I love the texture of the cream and how thick it is doesnt feel like a slab of goop going on feels expensive yet so affordable Feels so nice going on my skin and feeling great Im on my second jar now Love that there is no fragrance toonicancdddddmoisturized , Love how thick and nourishing this feels I get a feeling that everything I add underneath serumstoners get very well slugged under this moisturizer No smell which is lovely and super soft thick texture , Ive been using this night cream for a few months and havent noticed any changes in my skin I dont find it to be overly moisturizing , Very solid night cream with clinicallyreviewed ingredients Removing one star because its a bit pricey for what it is , Such an amazing night cream Perfect for my dry skin and keeps my skin hydrated throughout the night , I was looking for a thick cream that feels like glycerine and penetrating and its just that , Ive been using this product for 2 months now Its definitely a thicker cream that is very moisturizing during the winter months I hate the smell , Sorry but this product is not giving any effect on my skin lil disappointed , I like that this is a scentfree product  The texture of the cream is very nice  not at all oily and absorbs quickly but leaves skin feeling soft , I use this every night  love how my skin feels more firm  healthy the next morning , My favourite moisturizer for my oily skin Very thick like a balm it works so well to seal in the moisture over night and throughout the day It never irritates my skin even if my skin barrier is compromised for context even Skinfix couldnt do that The price is also way friendlier than Skinfix and holds the moisture in much better Though my skin is very oily this works so well for me even in the summer but I have to use less than in winter Could not recommend more , I started using this at the recommendation of a Sephora employee after my long time product Nourishing Moisturizer with Prebiotics was discontinued for some reason It works fine Its thick and creamy but does not feel heavy on my face A good night cream Im on my second jar but honestly I just want the former product back Why discontinue something people love sigh , Enjoyed this for the first few weeks as a dupe for skinfix but now it is solidified to a pastelike substance almost like a chalky sunscreen It takes forever for it to absorb and rub in to the ski major white cast Stick with the good stuff , Really love this night cream third time rebuying it Feel so nice on the skin heavy but skin absorb super fast  Really recommand this product for dry like oily skin Also super cheap compare to other brands , Felt very heavy on my skin all night I didnt notice a difference after using it for over a month Not worth the purchase , this cream sinks right into my skin plumps and hydrates This cream is worth the price and is made in France , I love this night cream Ive seen a few comments saying it doesnt work for oily skin but I dont find thats the case for me Im super oily and this doesnt break me out or anything Its a night cream so I expect it to be richer and more moisturizing It definitely doesnt make my skin feel gross or greasy it is a bit heavier though I find I only need a pea sized amount  Def makes my face feel firmer and plumper , Very hydrating and rich in texture perfect for my sensitive acne prone skin Fragrance free moisturizer that leave skin radiant the next day Compared ingredients to the Drunk elephant whipped face cream and I found the Sephora collection cream has the better ingredients on the top of its list Didnt break me out and I would recommend a acne serum underneath to prevent future breakouts and this cream on top to protect skin barrier Ive noticed my necklines were fading Definitely worth the purchase dont sleep on the Sephora collection very worth the hype , Love this moisturizer I have sensitive skin and I woke up with a smooth glowing hydrated skin Its also more ecofriendly overall , This may work for some but not for me I have aging dry sensitive skin Excited to try this especially with all the rave reviews After washing my face in the evening I applied this moisturizer It felt thick which was what I was looking for and after applying had a weird smell and just sat on my skin It never soaked in weird I woke up to very dry skin emphasis on dry This happened over several tries so this moisturizer is just not it The smell was kind of like a burnt oil smell offputting Im disappointed to say the least really wanted this to work especially for the price point , I love it It really smooth my face skin and not making my face too oily , I LOVE this moisturizer Disclosure  I have VERY dry skin I wouldnt recommend for oily skin but for me this is seriously moisturizing Its thick almost body butter consistency and a little goes a long way It leaves a layer on my skin but I like that and look for that especially in night creams , Nice product I have noticed firmer skin for sure Im still in the 28 day testing period Absorbs nicely Most likely will purchase again , Look no further This is my second bottle I received a free jar and once i ran out I purchased this one Few things you need to know most of it absorbs quickly but this is a rich thick cream so you will feel a thin layer on your skin for few hours Nothing gross or overwhelming but its there If you have oily skin you want to use something else Dry skin agin skin this is your dream come true My skin looked so good on day one I couldnt believe it Cant wait to see long term results A bargain for the quality , I love it It keeps my skin firm and moisturize I notice my wrinkles less noticeable , This night cream is like butter thick and very hydrating For my mixt to oily skin its really too heavy It made my face really shiny and oily I wont buy this again but for someone with very skin this could be good Iguess Also the price is decent for the amount , absolutely delighted I am absolutely delighted with this night cream Im 30 with dry skin Im always trying to find a night cream that truly hydrates my skin and tackles my dry patches I had previously bought a very popular night cream that is over double the price of this and was so disappointed as it felt thin and didnt so much for my skin This exceeded all of my expectations The packaging feels very nice and I like it has recycled plastic The cream itself is luxuriously rich but doesnt feel heavy or greasy I wake up with soft supple skin , This is a great night cream for the price I like that the cream is thicker but doesnt feel oily on my skin I previously was using Clinique firming night cream but I think I prefer this , Nice product apply it in night and wake up with fresh skin , I returned this one after purchasing both the AHA and the peptides night cream They have the same ingredients and this was 4 more Weird consistency pastey , I still cant believe how good this cream turned out to be especially for this price I have dry aging skin and Im also using tretinoin so I have some extreme dryness to combat I typically have to layer serums a night cream and a night time mask just for my skin to feel halfway hydrated by morning I ran across this cream when searching for night creams because I desperately wanted to pare down my routine but didnt have much hope Full disclosure when I read in the reviews that some folks found it greasy it made me want to give it a try I NEED greasy LOL Anyway it arrived and I tried it with zero expectations Applied it over my essence serums and tretinoin no mask or additional creams so I could see how it really performed The next morning I was shook My skin was dewy moisturized and didnt feel dehydrated for once Thinking it must be a fluke I tried it that same way night after night and had the same result This works better for me than ALL of the 100200 nighttime creams Ive tried and I havent had to use any of my overnight masks since I discovered this product If you have dry skin I highly recommend giving it a go Oily folks may find it to be too heavy but combo skin may find it beneficial in their dry areas This is definitely a night cream as it is somewhat occlusive once it absorbs and dries down but that is what I look for in a sleeping cream Ill buy this as long as Sephora keeps making itPLEASE dont discontinue this cream , I have combo skin and have been looking for a new affordable moisturizer  This one has exceeded my expectations  Ive been using it as a night cream and its transformed my skin  Its thick and seems like it is sitting on top of my skin but absorbs over night and my skin totally seems plump in the morning  Im sold , Its not like the regular firming cream Not as moisturizing It feels like it just sits on my skin instead of absorbing in like the other one did It just takes a lot to feel as moisturizing They made a new version of their regular moisturizing cream and got rid of the old one so i hope they dont get rid of this old version too bc its just not the same Not sure what the peptides are doing in this new formulation but its not feeling great , this works well as a hydrating night moisturizer I dont know that I saw increased firming but I really enjoy it as a soothing moisturizer post retinol , This must be a dream for very dry skin but as mine is combo this is too much It reminds me of the Prebiotics Sephora cream Formerly called 30 which I love but this one is probably 3 times thicker and feels harder to spread around for me , Very greasy I am sure some wouldnt mind feel greasy Not this girl , It doesnt go into the skin just stays on the surface and it flakes off Not impressed dont waste your money , Perfect for sensitive skin and a bit dry like mine The creamy texture is thick and no perfume My skin is hydrated and I love the result when I wake up , Its budget friendly But Dont like the texture on the face Its heavy But if someone like a creamy layer must go for it , Decent hydrating moisturizer but nothing special and doesnt deliver on promises According to Whats In My Jar the concentration of peptides is too low to be effective so if thats what youre looking for its not worth it I liked the texture and it was hydrating so it did its job as a regular moisturizer but you can find something simple at the drugstore for much less if all you want is a regular moisturizer Dont regret buying it  I liked the texture and it hydrated my skin  but wouldnt recommend or purchase again Ill stick with the ordinarys moisturizer for now , I like the fact that it is a simple peptide cream that I dont have to break the bank for its giving me the moisture I need and skin firming peptides It feels clean and has no fragrance , The perfect moisturizer for the winter months If youre DRY and looking for something to really hydrate and seal in your serumsthis is IT Im honestly obsessed , If youre looking for peptides to strengthen your skin barrier then do not get this cream It is just a moisturizer but it doesnt help with dryness or plumping much If youre looking for peptide strength look elsewhere , The first thing I noticed is like everyone says it is very thick A little goes a long way sure I really wanted to love this because of the smooth application but I cannot As soon as I start smoothing it over my skin and even on my neck my face turns BRIGHT red as if I have a sunburn I havent ever had a moisturizer do this to me I even turned pink on my neck and had these small red spots Rinsed my face and neck with cold water and the reddening was instantly better"
Germanium Stone Facial Massager,"I wasnt sure if this deserves 3 or 4 starts simply because Im a bit confused by this product  First of all it doesnt come with many instructions other than rolling it upwards from cheeks to cheekbones  And it says that the metal ball at the tip is supposed to provide a cooling sensation to the undereye area but I find that part kind of useless because its too big and doesnt really reach the undereye area when used as directed  You can try and press it under your eyes but the ball serves no purpose because its so small compared to the metal part around it that your undereye kind of drags sticks to the metal if you try to roll that ball on itSo I ended up treating this tool as Gua Sha and its advantage in my opinion is that you dont need any oil to massage your face with it  You can also keep it in the fridge and use it to depuff the face because it will stay cool for a couple of minutes  The sensation on the face is nice and with a little bit of pressure you can get a pretty good facial massage which will definitely increase the blood flow to your face  One major downside of this product in my opinion is that I dont understand how to clean it  There doesnt seem to be any way to disassemble it and it seems like the area under the rollers will inevitably get dirtied with the products we use on our face and things like thatSo I dont know really  The idea itself is interesting but this could definitely use some improvement , I just received this gadget and cant tell if it makes changes to my skin in a long run but I love the feel of this massage it definitely tones the skin and warms the underneath muscles The gadget is well made very substantial and pleasant to hold in the hand , I love this so much I keep it in the refrigerator and use it It helps so much with depuffing my under my eyes , Get it Worth the money Put it in the fridge and use it cold its very relaxing and soothing under the eyes and on the face , Perfect shape and feel I keep it in my refrigerator and use it every morning , Love this It really makes my face feel nicely tenderized It doesnt hurt to use and I feel relaxed after running it upward from my chin to my cheeks , Is this a necessary tool in your skincare regimen No but its so nice to use The stone parts are cool to the touch and it makes applying serums feel luxurious Definitely worth the purchase as it makes skin care fun"
Glow Peel Pads,"I didnt notice bugger all using this  I just didnt feel a difference in my skin , Its good product have many pads in theregive you glow and makes your skin look great The scent is a bit strong though and the pads my irate your skin if you press to hard , This is my go to exfoliant After using this product for a couple of months my skin looks more clear and even This product helped reduce those little pimplebumps on my forehead It can leave the skin feeling dry so I recommend using a good moisturizer and a HA serum once the product is absorbed by the skin , My most favorite product sold at Sephora I wipe my face 23 times a day and it prevents me from breaking out LOVE LOVE , These are amazing The Dr Dennis Gross pads used to be my holy grail then I tried these I have now been using them consistently for the past 4 months and am in love So budget friendly and jam packed with good skin benefits  , Love this product  Makes my skin feel soft and more even Used to use a similar product but that had an ingredient that caused irritation and this doesnt Not sure why so many problem have issues with the instructions theyre on the side Massage your skin morning and night Do not rinse , I love these Helped smooth my skin and helped with rednesses , I bought these because a YouTube recommended them for prep before makeup application but I havent seen any difference in my skin while using these , SHAME ON SEPHORA FOR NOT HAVING HOW TO DIRECTIONS Its your OWN brand  Retail store  Everybody checkout First Aid BeautyFacial Radiance Pads for directions and better quality product , Trs bon produit exfolie trs bien sans abmer la peau et jai remarque une trs belle diffrence sur ma peau jai limpression quelle est plus lisse , these are so great my holy grail pads are the FAB radiance pads and these are good I wouldnt say theyre AS good but they come close will buy again as they are so much cheaper than the FAB ones , amazing for texture I have really stubborn acne and bumps on my skin and after 12 uses they are almost gone no irritation or dryness either and I use it every day , Literally love this product I have dry spots on the sides of my nose and some parts of my forehead I use one pad at night wait for it to dry and then use all serums and moisturizers I can see the change with just 4 days of use , I highly recommend these peel pads I have gifted these to so many of my family and friends and the review its always how gentle they are  It helps to brighten the skin smooth texture and pores , Bought this in a kit to try them out so it didnt come with the full size container The only info on the packaging is almost completely in other languages aside from a small piece in English under the flap that tells you to discontinue if you notice irritation and that it may increase risk of sunburnI assume maybe the instructions arent on there because of the sample sized packagingso I go to your website and under the product page I click how to use and the only info youve supplied is how to recycle the packaging Come on Sephora this is your product I maybe would have rated it higher if I knew what I was supposed to be doing with these or what their desired effect is supposed to be , I bought this just cause it was half price in the store I never expected to see the results NOTHING has ever helped clear my acne I never had pimples until I was 19 This is a great product I usually wash my face do my exfoliate then wipe my face with these I use in the morning when Im too lazy to wash my face and at night sometimes even after I workout I highly recommend these and will definitely purchase when I run out , Beware Fragrance in the ingredients list thats all I have to say , I just bought it and tried it twice and seen a difference the next morning Forsure rebuying it , This glow peel pads are amazing for my skin I usually use this after washing my face and sometimes before applying my make up Leaves amazing canvas for my make up , Useless a t recommand par une employe mais contient plein de produit pas bon et ne change rien , Love this An staple in my skincare routine My skin is visibly sadder when I dont use a pad Typically use 2x a day morning  night , Used this for the first time before my friends wedding My skin looked really good and felt good immediately after but when I took my makeup off at the end of the night I was completely broken out Make sure to to patch test this one to see if its for you , I have very dry skin so if i dont moisturize or i forget to use my Lactic Acid drops the night before i have flakes And this is so quick  easy and works amazing for day of skin prep Especially for makeup artists it helps smooth the skin to prep for makeup , I havent had breakouts since high school Im 34 and just ran out of my glycolic toner so I thought Id try these My entire chin area has been breaking out horribly I would not recommend these at all , Great Dupe for the First Aid Beauty Radiance Pads The thickness of these pads are thinner but once you get past that they work just as well and are WAYYY cheaper , I loved these at first But they eventually broke me out  They are extremely gentle but couldnt continue to use them because they gave me millia and gave me blind pimples ingrown pimples Wouldnt recommend for acne prone skin , Very good for dark spots and acne prone skin Wish they where in larger packaging tho , I love these for an everyday exfoliant They are very gentle no burning or tingling but you see results over continued use I still use a stronger gel peel every week or so but for the price Im sticking to these for every day , I honestly feel as if I was using water when using this product  potency was very low at least it didnt cause my skin to break out I had glycolic pads in the past and this one felt like concentration is 00001 , I didnt notice much effect from these I would recommend the Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel Pads which are more expensive but I can see differences after 23 uses to notice more of a skin tone evening , Ive been using these pads for just over two weeks and I LOVE what they do for my complexion I have seen noticeable fading of age spots on my skin and my skin tone is much more even Highly recommend this product I have somewhat sensitive skin so I use one pad each morning instead of using an and pm , Ive used other similar products on the past that have almost immediate overnight effects These didnt do anything noticeable I also found them quite dry and didnt have a ton of the liquid Id sometimes use two pads since one never felt like enough , I dont use these on my facetheyre too strongbut they work WONDERS on my KP concentrated on my upper arms and butt Took a couple of weeks of daily use but my 43 year old skin feels so smooth now , Didnt do what it was intended to use Couldve just gone with a baby wipe , Ive consistently used these for almost two years and they are a great for daily use and help keep my skin from looking dull And they are a great price , If you have uneven skin complexion or just feel like your skin looks dull get the glow peel pads I tried the clarifying pads also but wasnt as impressed as much as I was with the glow pads Might try hydrating pads next Also Sephora skin care deserves more hype , I like these and find they dont bother my sensitive skin They dont work as well as gel peeling exfoliators in my experience but theyre nice because they dont require water and theyre great for travel , These pads were just what I needed to get rid of old tired skin cells and help build a healthy glowing complexion , These pads are awesome  My skin is normalcombination depending on the season and Ive never had acne or bad breakouts just one or two small pimples during my period  I used a facial oil that made me breakout on my cheeks and forehead plus gave me tiny little bumps all over my forehead  I dont have sensitive skin so this was surprising and I had no idea what to do so I gave these a try  My breakout was clear within a few days and the tiny bumps are gone  After the breakout pimples cleared there were a couple dark spots that I was worried about but I kept using these and the dark spots are almost completely gone  Ive only been using them for a little less than two weeks and Im really impressed with the results  These worked so quickly to clear my breakout and didnt have any negative effects on areas where my skin is a little drier if anything my skin feels more balanced overall  Ive used other much more expensive peels but these seem to work a lot better  Ive been using them twice a day and might cut back to every other day now that my skin has cleared up but Im definitely going to continue buying these , I wanted to like these so bad because they were highly recommended to me They worked alright for a few days and helped keep the oily skin down but after a few uses I started breaking out After I stopped use the breakouts went away and there were no new ones so that tells me it were the pads that made me break out They are gentle and dont have a bad smell but just didnt work for my skin I dont have sensitive skin either , Ive been using these for a month and have noticed visible improvement in skin texture They are pretty gentle I was using them every day for a bit without any harsh effects Definitely going to repurchase , Love these pads Works great on my face feel so refreshing and I have no bad reaction to it , Love these pads Quick and easy and leave skin refreshed and glory they smell fresh too  no funky residue or itchiness afterwards , I love these peel pads leave my face feeling so refreshed and they smell amazing , Feels refreshing on a clean face gives a light glow Great for sensitive skin , I like using these 12xs a week Leaves skin feeling softer  , I love these This is my second or third time buying and I will never go without I have oily skin and hyperpigmentation use to struggle with acne These clear up my skin SO quickly It does dry my skin out but thats the price you pay Just use moisturizer , I tried the mini size first because I was worried about my skin I have sensitive oily skin and have lupus so I have to be careful about what I use but I noticed lately that my skin has been dull although moisturised The ingredients in these pads are gentile and I noticed that my skin did actually have a healthier glow after about a week of use A great product for a great price , These pads changed my skin I used to have mini bumps on my forehead and chin and this made them almost nonexistent I would definitely recommend I use once a day and wouldnt go back  , Wanted to see a difference but havent I have used them a couple times and it feels like a soaked make up round Smells nice but didnt see any real effect Wonder if Im using them incorrectly , But if you are looking for something a bit stronger that you do not have to use as much I would recommend Ren brand glycolic mask instead for valueefficiency Glad I tried the mini size but on the fence about reorder for aging skincare needs in combination with my red skin light These pads also helps some with acne on 42 yr old combination skin , I wish there was more in there to use this because it really was helpful with my skin , After using these for about a week I noticed my makeup would sit better on my face and not cake up My face would always peel no matter how much I exfoliated and moisturized but adding these into my routine made all the difference , Sadly this did nothing for me Nice ingredients but not strong enough , I use this everyday in the mornings since I dont wash my face Its very gentle on the skin and it takes all the dirt off and gives you a glow Definitely 1010 recommend it Ive used 3 of the big jars so far , When covid first hit last year I decided to try some different skin care and liked what I read about the glow peel I even repurchased it multiple times never once thinking that all the acne that was popping up on my chin was related to it I just blamed it on having to wear a mask all the time And by acne Im not talking about little blemishes I had cystic acne going on They were large eruptions under the skin that would literally take 3 weeks to heal go down for a week and then resurface Wearing make up to try and conceal the redness just made the acne stand out more because the pigment would attach to the dry and raised skin And yes the majority of people would never know it was there because they couldnt see under the mask but I knew and I was self consciousAfter 10 months I stopped and began looking at what had changed in my skincare routine and the only thing was the glow peel I stopped using them and within a week the number of eruptions went down and after 5 weeks they have finally cleared up including the scars , Pretty good Makes my face feel good Havent had a breakout since I started using this , I originally bought the mini size to try out since I had heard that glycolic acid helped with acne scars  I loved these pads so much I bought the full size Definitely a nice starter if youve never tried acid treatments for your skin I use one pad every other night before bed  Ive definitely seen my scarring go down My face overall has a nice glow to it  feels fresher Wouldnt recommend using everydaymultiple times a day because itll strip your skin , Read about it before applying I have very flexible skiing type I can literally apply anything However with this product I developed strong reaction , Ive purchased this 3 times now it works great for me though I dont use it twice a day like it says I feel like my skin would hate that I only use it once a day two or 3 times a week , I want to like these but theyre ok I was hoping for a more dramatic effect or difference but it just felt like there was toner on the pads I dont hate them easy to use nice scent easy packaging but I wont purchase them again The price point is good for the product , Having tried a sample of amazing but expensive peel pads I was looking for a more affordable option These seemed rather promising Several of the reviews were glowing haha Unfortunately this wasnt the case for me I felt and saw no difference My face didnt clear up either I feel like I wasted the money I spent , So good for the price Ive tried several chemical exfoliants and Im always on the lookout for my next favorite These pads are really good for people starting out with exfoliants or if you just want to try them I love that theyre affordable but actually exfoliate without hurting your skin Some people use them in the morning and at night but I recommend that if youre starting with chemical exfoliants have dry or sensible skin only use them one time a day to try them out and give your skin a break to process the chemicals I personally use them once a day because I dont want to over strip my skin of the little oils it produces , I bought this as per Sephora employee recommendation after I told her I had combo oily but my skin would flake in certain spots She said I may need to exfoliate and showed me these Id never tried a chemical exfoliant before so I have nothing to compare these to However while used in conjunction with a moisturizer my skin has felt soft and not flaky I really thought to exfoliate you need abrasive scrubs to remove all the build up I also feel like I am not over exfoliating as I may with a scrub This has definitely sparked my interest in chemical exfoliant , Great odd that truly clean and hydrate the skin I use them daily and they do not dry out my skin or irritate it like other pads do Great price , I bought these for my 12 year old daughter who has been self conscious about breaking out quite badly for a little while now These in conjunction with the Sephora salicylic acid Clarifying serum have really cleared up her skin amazingly well She had quite sensitive skin but these dont bother her at all She uses the pads at night and the serum in the morning and it has worked wonders for her , Note I am a 21 yr old Asian woman with combination skinI started using these a week ago and I noticed a big difference for my acne Ive had some minor breakouts recently and after using the pads the pimples went away after a day I use them after toner and before moisturizing day and night one pad lasts me about two uses There was slight irritation during the first few times I used the pads but that went away quickly probably because of my skin adjusting to the acid my skincare routine before this didnt have any acids All in all I would recommend these , I use these every morning and night I have extremely dry skin and once or twice a week I will also use the Kate Somerville exfolikate scrub My face has been so much less dry and I can tell they are helping , Does nothing save your money The pads dry out really quickly if you do not use them right away , These are amazing at removing blackheads  I love using these in the morning every second day or so  My skin looks and feels glowy  So cheap  I swear I prefer these to the dr dennis aha pads , I am SHOOK  When I saw this I said What the heck For 8 I will try it  I am a 48 African American woman that has been dealing with rough and dry dull skin think dandruff like on my forehead and occasionally my temples and cheekear area This is my new HOLY GRAIL  My face is baby soft I cant stop touching my face I have sensitive skin so chemical based products wreck my skin The glycolic acid sugar cane is so gentle compared to name brand EXPENSIVE products For 8you have nothing to lose other than dead skin My makeup just glows now , ER Nurse here this has helped me tremendously to get rid of acne caused by having to wear masks for 13 hour days I use Youth to the People face wash then the peel pads followed by belif Aqua Bomb moisturizer holy grail combo , Seriously these work so well Dont spend money on the expensive brand get these , Was was hoping these would be a cheaper alternative to the Dr Dennis Gross exfoliating pads which are amazing but expensive I have been using these once a day for a month now and have not noticed a difference in the texture of my skin It is a little softer and not as dry The scent is nice seems to be the samesimilar across the Sephora skincare products The pad itself is thin and somewhat insubstantial rolls up on itself when using it on my face definitely needs stiffer embossing Will not buy again after finishing this package , I used one pad for two applications morning and night and Im almost through the container So its been over 3 months and Ive noticed no difference Im sure it doesnt hurt but Ive not noticed it helping much either Didnt love it didnt hate it Wont repurchase , Convenient product but didnt see a difference in my skin at all even after using the whole package Going back to my dr Dennis beta wipes , I got these from Sephora to review My skin is dry and sensitive I rarely get a pimple These pads did not irritate my sensitive skin and it didnt dry it out either These arent something I would normally use but I would say if you are looking for an oxy pad type product this one is great It has no scent Has a little tingle feel to it Id recommend it , These are nice They help if I use them everyday and when I do use them I wipe my face until the pad is dry My chin is my nightmare Menopause is my nightmare Mask make it worse Ive had to practically change up my whole face routine because of this triple threat as I never had pimples when I was young and here I am at 54 becoming a pimple face This product helps cut down on the blackheads and pimples without drying my skin out my skin is usually dry but not lately I do think theyre a little pricey but worth it I tried generic ones and they were too harsh Anyway I can at least recommend these for women my age going through the same issues , Good product but I was expecting better results with the price , I have sensitive skin and stopped used any physical exfoliants a while ago Ive been using these pads twice a week for a couple months and havent noticed a difference My skin doesnt react to these at all and I am super sensitive so Im wondering if they are weak , I use these on my chest for any breakouts I get there and they work great My face did not react well to these but theyre great for body acne , Incredible for maskne and getting rid of the typical discoloration that comes after blemishes , I LOVE this product It does wonders for my skin I use it every day , These were really nice to my skin  didnt irritate or burn my sensitive skin I used these for 3 weeks now and my skin is soft and clearer The price is fantastic for such a great product , I am enjoying the SEPHORA COLLECTIONGlow Peel Pads They gently clean my skin without leaving a burning feeling afterwards that I have experienced with other similar products , The pads I got were moist and not soaked Not very happy with the quality of this product I use two a time so that the application is effective , I am pretty sure the I ordered these to meet the free shipping limit and so happy that did  I have been using them for roughly two weeks The pad is super thin and easy to grab they are soaked so the coverage is perfect  There is a light pleasant scent it does not linger  My face does turn slightly red after using but the  color returns to normal shortly after  I have noticed a difference in my skin pores are smaller and my dark spot from skin damage are not as dark I have never used a product like this one but I am happy that I tried it out and would purchase it again , I love these so much I use them at night and have definitely noticed some mild peeling from them as well as smoother skin I will definitely be stocking up on these , Effective yet gentle exfoliation Great for everyone use Scent is pleasant not too strong , Ive received it as sample 3 weeks ago so I used and waited to see any change I have combination and super sensitive skin so i cant use anything on my face I like this one but I think they need to add more products on the pads , I havent noticed a big difference in my skin while using these though I only use them sporadically and not morning and night I havent had any skin irritation though and they dont have a strong scent like others do The pads themselves are very thin and not very moist , Love these pads Use them twice a day now to help with mask acne Just bought them again The price is excellent , I love this product it really works for my skin type The pads are not rough or soft but just right Got rid of my dry skin but you have to keep using it to see more and more results , Love these Leaves my skin clean clear and glowing Ive tried so many other products and this is my HG peel pad I tend to break out really bad and these have completely tamed my skin I use am and pm and I cant go without them for a day , Have been using these for a couple months and I feel like they actually made a difference They are not too harsh on my skin and can be used daily , When I got these my expectations were low I was expecting that noxema really strong scent when I opened them There is a fragrance but it is light and I think it is pleasant These feel nice and arent too abrasive If you know that your skin responds well to glycolic acid this would be a great affordable product , These pads are wonderful  My skin really responds to the glycolic acid in these and it definitely made my skin glow after using them  Honestly the difference was quick and noticeable  I just wish they were not infused with fragrance , I use one each morning Really helping my dull skin Great price too , Compared to PTR and Elemis peel pads these seem the exact same Maybe a little less powerful but I have sensitive dry skin and these are just as amazing as PTR and Elemis for a lot lot less , SEPHORA  Glow  Peel  Pads  are  cool  strip  your  clogged  pores  and  make  skin  look  refreshed  I  needed  a  facial  This  is  a  good  steep before  getting  a  professional  to  unclog  pores , i have to say that for the price these toner pads are really great The formula is definitely effective but not irritating and i have super sensitive skin So if youre looking for a toner peeling product  that wont irritate eczema rash prone skin this is greatthat being said after shopping around on products i have to say that products like this that are on preprovided pads arent the best for you money products that come in a bottle that you put on a cotton pad or whatever individually are a much better deal but this product does work really well i just wish they sold a bottle of the toner rather than the pads , Sometimes I get dry or flaky from 05 tret daily use and these pads are great for clearing flaky skin without being drying or burning Plus the price is definitely right , this product did nothing for my skin I would pass on this product , I used these typically after cleansing my face in the shower and before putting on toner and other serums before bed Didnt really notice any effects I would consider repurchasing to see long term effect , I was skeptical about this product from reviews but took the risk and it was honestly really good My face had broken out the worst it ever has due to wearing face masks all day at work and this helped clear my face in a couple of days Very satisfied with the results and will continue to use this , This product didnt do anything for me My skin felt a little bit nice after using it but there was no visible changes I have used 23 of it , These are great to use before bed or when you wake up in the morning I also like to use them after I take off my makeup You can visibly tell that your face is clearing up the day after you use one I have drier skin with some ache and it repairs my skin everywhere I was hesitant it would work at first because its just a pad you wipe on your face but over time you can tell that it has cleaned your skin I especially found that this product works better in the summer when my skin is different all over Not sure how well it will work during the winter when my skin is very dry , I have very sensitive skin and this has worked very well for me My skin looks smoother for sure , I really enjoy this product I purchased the smaller one because I have very sensitive skin and Wasnt sure how this would react with my skin type I had no issues with it whatsoever Its gentle enough to use day and night and leaves my skin smooth and soft It defiantly rivals much more expensive products Ive purchased in the past Will purchase again , I love these pads I use them before I put on my makeup and they make me look super glowy plus they get all the dead skin off , These are just ok nothing special not bad not as moist but they do ok , I really like these They get the job done I can use them 23 times a week without excessive peeling Theyre not too harsh but are strong enough to lift dead skin , Have been using this product for over a year I absolutely love the ingredients My face feels invigorated but not too tingly My skin glows after each use I originally got the product to combat my combo oily skin and adult acne I am trying to wean myself off of benzaclin for acne which requires a prescription I use this every other night and have had great results along with hyrolonic acid and vitamin C I plan to start using it every night and Im so excited to have finally found my skin regimen thanks to the addition of this glycolic acid , This product makes me have all kinds of acne  I normally have almost no acne  I would not recommend it , I wish I could give these pads six stars They are by far the most impactful part of my skin care regimen which includes products Ive spent upwards of 100 on I truly cannot understate how much I love these pads I have dry skin and these pads clear away all the dead cells and help all my other products absorb better My foundation looks better as these pads have made a huge difference in the smoothness of my skin This is the best money you will ever spend Seriously it will change your life , Ive never used peel pad until now Im 51 Wow Ive been missing out all I can say is my skin LOVED this glycolic ingredientmy skin did a complete 180 to be luminous and soft Will never go without these , Tried these for a few days until my entire face broke out My skin isnt usually sensitive and I usually never break out I would rather use Oxy pads over these Would not recommend , I love them Perfect if you want something thats not too harsh or you are new to peels Theyre wet enough to do my whole face with one pad I use one a week and thats enough for me The texture of my skin is so much better , Worked at first but I kept breaking out every time I use it , Started using this 23 times a week as recommended by a friend who is an aesthetician and my skin feels so much better Its helped to really turn over my dry skin and help it look plumper and fuller , While the formulation is very gentle and will perhaps take several weeks or more of daily use to show resurfacing abilities after putting this on before a moisturizer and then washing your face in the morning you can tell its working to help gently exfoliate and keep your texture top notch Also the price is AMAZING considering other premium brands like Goop are charging upwards of 45 for the same 5 glycolic acid content Have been using for 3 months and will keep going so , Not enough formulaliquid in the pads They should be fully saturated with it instead theyre pretty dry , the scent is nice the results are amazing Im excited to find peel pads with salicylic acid and not just aha this will stay in my routine , Awesome product for such a price Enough liquid inside to prevent drying out pads are thin but I had no problem with using it not as strong as Dennis Gross ones but it does job leaves your skin feeling clean super soft and nice Just use it on clean dry skin at night and feel your skin getting softer right after  would recommend it , Im giving this product 3 stars because Im not sure I understood what they were supposed to do to my fa"
Glow Peel Pads with AHA + PHA,"This stuff is magic You get so much bang for your buck with plenty of pads that lasted me months Left my skin noticeably more glowy and so easy to use Highly highly recommend , I dont think theres anything I dislike about this product I only wash my face at night but will use these in the morning before my jojoba oil  moisturizer  my skin has never looked soooo good From the first use my skin was glowing  Ive noticed my tiny breakouts disappearing Will keep repurchasing , I know this product works for so many people but for me it doesnt It burnt my face and it was red for days Maybe its just not great for sensitive skin , I use it in between my Ordinary toner and its gentle and nonirritating on my sensitive combination skin I also use it for my armpits after shaving Each pad is very thin so be careful to separate them , Awesome Worth the price Made my skin glowy and cleaned my nose well , I will say that this product not only surprised meit is budget friendly and good for sensitive skin I was using the Dr Dennis gross which kind of worked for me but when I saw the reviews on this producti decided to give it a try I have no regrets I tried this I had horrible break out around my chin areas and dark spots but believe me when I say in 2 weeks my breakouts was gone no reoccurring breakouts My dark spots gradually fading out I was using the pixi hydrating milky cleanser and then the Mac lightful C3 skin renewal lotion and tatcha dewy skin moisturizer and all this products have saved my skin , I am BLOWN AWAY by this product I started developing terrible acne about a year ago and nothing was helping despite regular facials and a solid routine Ive tried prescriptions and pretty much every over the counter product there is My routine now consists of these wipes pm only  theyre a little drying along with the Sephora brand moisturizer and Vanicream face wash I also use these wipes on my chest and shoulders No more blackheads or breakouts Sephora THANK YOU , Bought these as its wallet budget friendly  i normally like the elmis resurfacing pads but those are so expensive this is a good alternative doesnt smell bad like some resurfacing pads So far so good so lets see , I was gifted these along with a couple other Sephora brand products and they are a game changer I am very oily and prone to blackheads and my blackheads are essentially gone Cant recommend enough , Very nice Help with cleansing of the face and makes my skin feel soft and smooth without breaking out , I purchased these as a more cost effective alternative for the first aid beauty radiance pads and I love them way more I have been through a few containers now and using them a couple times a week before bed I wake up with smooth glowing skin I have combination sensitive skin and I dont find them irritating or drying with that frequency of use , I really like these Did not make me break out which is always a concern for me when trying new products Also for the oily girlies use these as a prep before makeup and it keeps the oil at bay , Utilis depuis 2 semaines jai not une amlioration notable dans la texture de mon piderme , advised to try this for under eye milia used it regularly and it had no noticeable effect and didnt improve texture I finished the product and it didnt seem to change anything afterwards either Can only attest to the fact that its ok for sensitive skin  , love these pads great for my sensitive skin easy to use and doesnt dry my face out  , I received these peel pads in a gift basket gift from my students university seniors in Dec 2022 Those girls are in the know because these pads work Within a week my skin was brighter and softer , I have purchased this twice in 2 months Its super gentle and almost feels like you are just rubbing water pads on your face But the proof is in the results It has lightened my dark spotsangivgivenmme a notuceable glow , Loving this so far Ive been using it for just under a week and my face already looking better I mostly concentrate on my problem areas like my nose and temples where I get buildups of sebaceous filaments and its already reducing them , After using this product for nearly two months I highly recommend it There is no smell it is very gentle and leaves your skin looking radiant This is what has worked for me I use the Fenty cleanser followed by the peel pads I let the pad soak in for a minute or two and then I follow up with my Laneige moisturizer Thats itI decided to wear no makeup during this process to see how the products would work and work they did Initially I felt uncomfortable because I wasnt able to conceal my blemishes and dark spots but they visibly started fading and now my skin looks so healthy Others have noticed as well and Ive gotten so many compliments on my glow I also have hormonal acne and have not yet experienced my usual flareup , Dont sleep on this Effective product without over dryingirritating AND without ridiculous price tag I love using an acid exfoliant a few times a week and this product makes it SO EASY , This is literally the first exfoliating product Ive tried that makes my skin soooo smooth without causing redness or irritation Absolutely amazing and super gentle , I have large pores that are clogged and nothing I have ever used has cleared them THIS stuff is amazing Most slept on Sephora product ever An amazing value and I have been getting so many compliments on my skin Doesnt over dry either Love this , i bought it because why not it was cheap and I needed one of these pads the reason being the salicylic acid one was sold out and I bought it let me tell you my skin is sooo soft smoothe and GLOWING its superrr glowy Im in love , I dont normally write a review for anything Bought these because I wandered into Sephora on my bday and wanted to treat myself I have acne scars I wanted to heal up I did not expect this glow Yes it says glow but like I am radiating And its not sparkles or shimmer its just my skin And pores So I have pores anymore Nope Gone Make up glides on I have sensitive skin and 1 week in using daily no issues in fact no acne now this is a miracle I am going to stock up I never wanna be without these little pads Im telling everyone to try them Im not even big into beauty just wanted a little feel better bday present The acne scars are fading of course the deep ones will need something more invasive , I tried the doctor Jart daily peel pads in a sample and loves them I cant speak to how well they work long term but the price point on those is ridiculous for not much more in the way of better formulation These are super gentle do not sting even after Ive shaved my face and cleansed I wipe these gently on my face until the pad is dry and then apply a serum over top I wouldnt recommend using any other exfoliating products after or before this but these are gentle and I use a gentle retinol afterwards some days and the way your skin glows after and is so smooth is crazy I genuinely use mine every day and have had no issues As always build up if youre new to chemical exfoliants as they can be sensitizing , I usually never write reviews but this product deserves one I bought this on a whim since it had no reviews when I purchased and was hoping it would be effective at clearing some blackheads I was experiencing Not only is it working at helping clear my blackheads but it is also helping fade some acne scaring and keeping my skin clear I have acne prone sensitive skin and this does not irritate me AT ALL I will continue to purchase these as it is an all round fantastic product , Pads work fine and leave no residue on your face but the smell is very unpleasant , These are really effective I have oily skin and Ive been using them as a skin prep before I do my makeup It keeps me less oily throughout the day and doesnt let my makeup crack My foundation always cracked when I wasnt using this Its also very gentle and doesnt tingle it also doesnt really have a smell which is nice considering I sometimes get sensitivity My skin feels nicer plumper healthier and overall looks more even in tone I will be repurchasing for sure , Ill never buy this name brand again It honestly works better than the products that are 20 dollars more My skin tone is more even its softer and Im having better results than my other products Do not pass on this bc it isnt a fancy brand name Its now on my shelf forever , Je vois une grosse diffrence sur ma peau elle est vraiment plus clatante et jai moins presque plus de boutons sauf pendant mes rgles jen ai un mini alors rien de fou Elle laisse un fini collant mais ce nest pas drangeant puisque ce produit sutilise le soir ma peau est grasse au matin mais une fois lav tout vas bien Je nai pas pris de photo avant malheureusement javais beaucoup de cicatrices dacn Je recommande"
Gradual Self-Tanning Face Gel,"I would give a 0 if I could I have pretty fair skin I have used this product multiple days in a row and nothing It has not made me a shade darker Jergens lotion works better than this Dont recommend at all , This is my second purchase of this product No streaks Nice natural color , I am not a fan of this product  It does give a nice glow  Despite the claims of being non sticky I have to disagree  I found this to have a sticky feel even after it dried I will not buy again , Better to spend money on tan luxe or ilse of paradise  I am using for body but I dont think it even works for that , I have been self tanning for years so I have tried a lot of different self tanning products Unfortunately with this product I dont notice any difference I was so disappointed with the results I ended up buying the Bondi Sleep Mask instead which I like so much better , Love this product I love that it doesnt make my skin break out either , Great find It tans pretty deeply so I used a very small amount of the tinted gel and rubbed it in with my moisturizer so that I would not get too much color Perfect I am very surprised at this price after having tried many face tanners which were higher priced , This give my face a really nice It is a bit sticky and the smell is strong but you cant beat it for the price point and clean ingredients , Cette gele ne me rend pas orange elle donne un petit teint naturel ce qui est parfait pour lhiver Je ne suis pas blanche mais je nai pas lair de revenir de deux semaines  Cuba non plus Je recommande , I just received this product and when I applied it to my face it went on smooth A little goes a long way which is good and not wasteful I saw results within only 3 hours and it was a good difference I had an even coverage and it was a beautiful tan not orange On the bottle you can apply twice a day depending on how dark you want I have also discovered that it darkens depending on your skin tone duh lol I also went to work after I applied and the tan did not come off on the mask and it has stayed on through face washes and makeup removal wipes Highly recommend , Smells good but applies patchy and orange It was on sale so only 10 but ten bucks wasted , This self tanner gives a little glow I use it twice a day Would of liked a darker pigment but its a good buy if you dont wanna be too dark , Did not go on evenly  looked like I had burns on my face , I LOVE this stuff Ive been indoors way too much lately and was in desperate need of some color I really like the sweet caramel scent of it It applies easily and isnt too sticky when it dries down However there is a bit of tackiness My favorite results came after applying twice overnight Then I just shower and do my regular face routine in the morning I still have great color with zero tackiness I also love the size It should last quite awhile , Give me good even color Did not love the smell but that is to be expected Preferred using it on my body then on my face , This is not it I have tried this so many times and its just not what I thought it would be It becomes so sticky and tacky on your face and even if you get every inch of your face hairline and neck it still somehow manages to be patchy It clings to certain spots and is never even Super orange colour too , Smell is not that great Leaves me feeling a bit oily but the result is pretty good , I used this product daily on my face and it didnt provide any colour no matter how often I applied De finitely not buying again The only plus and the reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is that it didnt break me out at all which was great and the reason why I kept trying and hoping it would work I really had such high hopes Ill be trying tanning drops next , Un effet trs naturel mais qui est trs beau Facile dapplication Il ne faut pas sattendre  avoir un bronzage ultra fonc avec ce produit , So after reading a lot of reviews about this stuff I wasnt sure to get it or not but I did Its not like an i just came back from a week in Bermuda tan but it does give you a nice tint and subtle glow , Suits my fair skin type 2 Its kind of subtle and I get why some people with any darker than fair skin tones would be disappointed with this tanner but I glad I found something for me Doesnt makes uneven spots and did not cause any beakouts on my acne prone sensitive skin , this is definitely my go to face tanner i was hesitant at first reading previous reviews that were saying they didnt see any difference whatsoever and i have kind of medium olive colored skin and the fact that its a gel product made me hesitant because i didnt want it to dry my skin out or make me break out i tried it out anyway and i woke up the next morning to a beautiful glowy tan i washed my face moisturized and then put on the face tanner if you are looking for a darker tan i would apply the product more often after its dried for a couple of hours , Ive been using self tanners for years and tried this one out because of the price Its good value compared to other face tanners but honestly not very strong at all I notice a difference the next morning but its very slight Prob better to spend the money to get a stronger one thats also better for your skin , I wanted to love this product but unfortunately after using it for 3 days applied once day I didnt see any difference and Im really fair so I was surprised Also caused me to break out , i love this stuff i personally use it every day it adds a nice subtle glow for during the cold months i mix mine with my moisturizer and use it every morning i love the smell and it doesnt break me out or anything natural looking glow and its pretty hard to have looking streaky or patchy because its gradual just be sure to blend well  , If you no longer want to look like a sickly Victorian era child this is the product for you AKA I am a pale person two applications and I have a beautiful even glow that has given me some really nice color 100 recommend  I have pale skin with pinkish tones and there is no orange here , Did not do anything for me I think that you would have to have very fair skin like Snow White pale for this to show any kind of difference Dont bother buying if you have light or light medium skin tone , I dont get the bad reviews this is a great self tanning gel It gives you a very natural tan it smells great doesnt have the gross self tanner smell fades very well Im on my second tube and I feel like stocking up because I know what Sephora does with my favorites It doesnt break me out like other self tanner do I can wear it under my makeup I just try to wait 30 min before I apply my makeup , Feels nice Not sticky Doesnt give the nice deep color that the Clinique face tanner does Honestly can hardly tell it gives color I would say a very minimal color even with 34 days of use If you want a noticeable color youd need to use morning and night daily Smell is fine , I love this cream which gives me a subtle but effective glow At first I didnt notice the difference but after about three days of daily use i had an even  sun kissed skin tone  Just enough for people to say you look well  you look pretty today not marked enough for people to pinpoint quite why Just what I wanted  , It gave some color but not as much as I would have liked I used it every day twice a day for a couple of weeks and the smell is awful Its very strong typical tanning lotion smell For the price I was hoping for better results , Really impressed  perfect gradual self tanner Didnt go orange on me and they usually do , Love this gradual face tan gel it works great If you want a deeper more noticeable tan do it twice the first day I even used it on my arms  legs  , Nice Product not sticky mild fragrance no streaks , Not the best tanning product out there but it does give you a nice glow Ive noticed that the product dries the heck out of my skin though so I had to stop using it made my blackheads even worse Doesnt layer well with makeup , Really impressed It gave me a naturallooking subtle tan after 34 days of use No orange Didnt gather in wrinkles , Perfect bit of color very very minimal on one application but over time it builds up beautifully I havent experienced any streaking or weird fading Dont spend 30 on other face tanning products try this first Its great , I am determined to wear SPH 1000 on my face this summer but I dont want to look like a ghost either so I purchase this one as well as ST TROPEZs Self Tan Purity Vitamins Face Serum because why not lets test them both out Overall I love them both This one is a touch more aggressive off the bat I put it on after a shower on a freshly cleaned face go back into the bathroom a few hours later and OOOOooOOOo I have some colour but I would say doesnt last as long as the other product I purchased which honestly isnt a bad thing I think I have more control with this one to be honest If I want to be glowly tonight for whatever reason I know this will do it with one application and then I just reapply every day or so to keep it going Scent is nice I like the colour as well I didnt feel too orangey I asked all my friends if my face looked weirdoff and they all said no haha So thats a bonus I would buy again , It smells really good Not like most tanners Doesnt break me out and gives me a very subtle tan I wish it was even a little darker May try applying twice daily , its ok Much rather StTropezGives more of a glow then a tan Made me breakout , I have light skin but develop a bit of a tan in the summer This is VERY gradual I definitely apply two layers just for my face to match the Sephora body spray tanner But the gradual effect definitely helps minimize streakiness or other obviously missed spots if you forget to put some onaround your earsI dont think it smells weird but Im one of those people who tend not to be bothered by selftanner smell I did notice that it can sting a bit on days that my skin feels more sensitive ie after using retinol serums but it goes away quickly It feels somewhat hydrating but if youve got dry skin you might want to put on moisturizer after useIts nice for as an introduction product if youre new to self tanning but if you want to get dark definitely pass and buy something else , This does exactly what it says it does Gives a gradual natural looking tan I personally use it every other day in the morning and it gives me a great glow , I tried it for over a week and it didnt go well with my routine I had makeup peeling which never happens and had obvious patches of colour I tried it for over a week to make sure it wasnt my application I dont think this formula is the one for me Id recommend it for others not for meFYI its like a clear gel thats sticky , I like this product At first I was kinda a bit orange but than I woke up and washed my face  now I AM THE PERFECT tan colour The orange is gone I always love self tanning  I am always scared to put stuff on my face because I break out easily  so far so good Highly recommend this  the smell is not bad , Ive used self tanning cremesgels before and I have to say that this one takes the top spotIt didnt come out orange it didnt highlight any wrinkles or lines in my skin at all and it added a nice light golden glow It also absorbed really fast This gel is not sticky eitherI would purchase this again for winter time to add a bit of a glow  , I found this just ok Gives a little bit of nice color after one application but most of the color disappears after washing my face at night I have to apply this pretty much every night to keep my face the color I want which sucks because this doesnt break me out and I like the tropical smell I probably wont repurchase because its a hassle to have to apply every night , Whats with  the Orange    lol Not good at all found it to be very heavy scented Not for me , I love this It doesnt make me look orange and it doesnt make me breakout Its perfect for summer and affordable , Works well nice color minimal scent and the fragrance didnt irritate my rosacea Nice healthy glow that is actually pretty dark The only critique I could give this is that the gel texture dries a bit tightly or sticky on the skin , This is amazing It doesnt make me look orange It adds just the right amount of colour for me And to top it all off its a clean product and not over priced This will definitely be some I will keep on hand , I am naturally tanned being half black and half white but I needed a little color after this long Canadian winter I wasnt sure if this was even gonna work me but it gave me a really nice glow that wasnt too orangy  I used a small peasize amount all over my face and as the day went on I could see my skin slowly becoming more bronzed The color lasted around 4 days before I needed to reapply and it did not irritate my skin Definitely worth it especially for the price , Tried this because of the price and was so pleasantly surprised Its very easy to apply I will take a shower and exfoliate then apply this on my face It gives your skin a great blur effect because of the glow Colour is great definitely not orangey Will keep in my routine , Love this gradual tan gel I find that I get good results a desired color fast by applying then waiting about 2 12 and reapplying for a really good bronze wait a other 2 12 hours and apply again I took one star off because I did notice that the tan itself does not last more than a day and a half two days if you showerwash your face at least once a day Otherwise I would absolutely snag this product up it will last you quite a while too if your just doing your faceneck But please do keep in mind this did only last on my skin max two days so I was basically putting it on every night before bed , First of all I would like to applaud The Sephora Collection for having a clean and ALCOHOLFREE self tanner especially for the faceAlmost every self tanner Ive tried in the past dries out my skin and only leaves my face blotchy and irritated This is a much skinfriendlier product and still provides decent results The first round I used it on top of my regular skincare regimen which I think diluted the tanner and inhibited the darkening of my skin I used it another time when I was at home and used it by itself after washingexfoliating my face I noticed better results that round and followed my skin with my regular skin care after achieving my desired shade It shall remain in my basket of summer necessities this year , I usually dont go for self tanners for the face because a lot of them dont look natural but this is great I thought id try it because the price was good  I saw results after the first application and it really gave me a nice natural glow There is that certain time in the winter where your skin looks blah and this just really makes you look you went on a vacation  I  use it every couple of days just to maintain I really love it , This Stuff WORKS I have been trying to find a face tanner that actually works doesnt dye my eyebrows and doesnt make me breakout and this is the one Ive tried so many I couldnt be happier with this product and it is actually affordabledoesnt have any bad products in it If you are thinking about it do seriously , Love this product went in for a tester and went back to buy the tube  Finally a product that applies well and looks Fab , I love the way this smells and that its clean  It gives me a subtle glow after one application which is all Im really going for in the winter  It absorbs quickly and the price is right  I havent tried building it up to see how it will be for summer when I go darker but so far so good  Also hydrating which is a plus , oompa loompa alert  cheap product doesnt smell bad like most of the self tan ive used in the past but leave you with an orange face i wish it would be a great product but saddly its not , The first thing I love about this is that it has an extremely minimal scent when first applied and even after having it on for hours or sleeping it doesnt end up with horrible tanner smell close to my nose The gel is refreshing and absorbs almost completely within the first 2 minutes so Im not worries about rubbing it and getting uneven marks The colour comes out fine I think there is a slight orange tinge after the product has been on a while and before it is rinsed off but when rinsed it looks healthy I build it up over 23 days before using it roughly every other day to maintain the colour Price point is great as well , I gave it at least two stars because it may work well for others The gel was a little sticky After one use it made my face look a little orange and dirty , I usually self tan my body  in the summer to keep my skin out of the harmful sun rays and winter to keep up a nice glow i hate the look of a tan chest and lighter face plus tanning your face helps you to use less foundation as well so you save excess product but my tanner that i love for my body usually breaks me out on my face as im more sensitive This face gel smalls amazing it look a few applications daily   the directed re apply after 3hrs for a more intense glow for me personally to build up a similar shade to my chest however once I did that ive only been needing to re apply every few days after my skincare routine  only because I make sure to exfoliate 23 times a week this way it maintains the glow I highly recommend this product It works amazing smells delicious and is a great price , Love this product It makes your skin have a very natural tan glow , This is my favorite of all the face self tanners I have tried This one is hydrating and gives you a very natural bronze glow to the skin It doesnt apply streaky and its very easy to use It also has a nice smell , This is the best face tanner I have used One of the best qualities in this face tanner is the smell It smells good when you put it on and does NOT start to smell like a normal selftanner after wearing it for hours I love that it is a gel because it feels extra hydrating putting it on The color it gives you is a beautiful sunkissed glow and it immediately gives your skin a radiant glow right after application The color is not orange at all It is also fool proof because it is a gradual tan This means it wont look streaky easily Definitely give this a try"
Gradual Tanning Drops Face & Body,"I was needing a new self tanner when I noticed this one was scent free too bad it is the streakiest tanning drops I have ever tried Not even worth the 20 dont buy , I was looking for a subtle self tanning kind of product but thought Isle of paradise was a little pricey Found out this one a few weeks ago and I fell in love When I tell you it took 4 days and people at eork asked if I went on a trip The more drops you use the more tan you will be Im a white woman kind of pale with neutral undertones and dark brown hair I used 4 to 5 drops every other night It felt great not sticky at all I blend it eith my Cerave moisturizer I would 100 recommend love it  , Its okay but you have to be very careful to blend really good or else you will end up blotchy  the tan will look very fake , You definitely have to have a heavy hand with this if youre pale  one singular baby drop into whatever youre using This looked really orange and splotchy with my moisturizer Im considering returning this , I got this product because I ran out of the isle of paradise drops and my wallet was hurting after Christmas There is only the one shade and I would call it light This gave me a very slight glow which was nice and left no botches which I usually get using the isle of paradise I gave this 45 stars only because it was so subtly but for the price I think it is worth it which , Ive used this 6 times total so far every other day during winter and Im really happy with the glowy colour I have gotten I didnt want anything to dark and its giving me just the right amount of colour It was a bit of trial and error for the moisturizer you mix it with cause I initially did it with the Ordinary moisturizer and it sucked then I used a No7 moisturizer and it was perfect , Jutilise maintenant le produit depuis 1 semaine chaque jour Jai remarqu que mon teint devenait plus bronz Teint naturel jadore je recommande , Maybe mine was defective but I gave it three tries and used the max number of drops 8 on the face and it did nothing"
Grapefruit Peeling Mask - Skin Perfection,"Everything about this is misleading An actual peeling mask starts as a gel and then dries so you can PEEL it off This stays a gel that you wash off For all those saying it says to wash your face with warm water idk what you expected just about every mask including actual peeling masks say that To get rid of any residue However THIS was a waste of money I already have an exfoliating scrub I wanted a mask that PEELS Stepped out of my usual peeling mask brand and Im disappointed Only plus is it smells good but since there are little beads in it I wouldnt even recommend using this more than a couple times a week as Im sure its abrasive And no its not a chemical peel either Save your money , I thought this was a peel OFF mask but its a skin sloughing mask Still really great makes my skin so soft and you cant beat the price , Not an acid peel not a type of mask you peel off The instructions on the bottle says 3 minutes which is laughable for an acid peel the website says 10 No details anywhere on if it has an AHA content which would be necessary for an acid peel Theres much more effective products out there for the same price , I went to the store and I asked for a peeling mask and this is what they recommended This is more of a light face scrub that you massage and then wash off I was disappointed to say the least , This is more of a leave on gel that you massage and then wash off I really enjoyed the grapefruit scent and the exfoliating pieces in the mask I think a little goes a long way and that I could get more than 5 uses out of it so its definitely worth the price , smelled nice wouldnt call this a peeling mask though its more like a gel that sits on the skin and you wash it off did make my skin look more refreshed and took away any shine , It smelled very nice but I dont think it did much It also stung a little , it is not a peeling mask it is more like an face scrub and also on the app it says 10  min but on the package when it comes in say 3 min , This is supposed to be a peeling gel  Does not do anything  Does not cause any peeling  Has rough pieces in it to exfoliate but it feels more like hard apricot kernel or walnut pieces from the drugstore exfioliators that killed your skin rather than the gentle face peel gel that this claims to be  Smell is not too obnoxious but does not really smell naturally like grapefruit  Would not recommend at all , Smells great and its been a nice little add to my skincare routine now that Im always at home Only reason I didnt give a better score is because it is NOT a peeling mask Or at least what you as a consumer would expect My skin was nice and refreshed afterwards the same effect I get with most of the other formulas but I purchased mostly because I thought I could have that fun peeling experience but its not too bad outside of that especially for the price Ill probably only repurchase through a sale or promo , This product is amazing and I highly recommend it if you want soft smooth and clear skin I had very dry and crusty skin but after i used this product i had perfect skin , Its ok but if your main goal is a peel off mask look elsewhere , this mask is pretty nice it burns a little bit but doesnt leave redness if you have sensitive skin do not buy this  it needs a better name because i thought it was a PEEL off mask but it isnt , this face mask is amazing i had really oily skin and acne but after using this my skin was glowing and really smooth and not oily at all highly recommend , I got a number of masks from this collection in Sephora Russia The grapefruit one is my favorite along with the Aa one This mask smells lovely and Im sensitive to heavy smells It easy to apply and wash off But most importantly my skin feels so soft and clean after using it It certainly gives my face more brightness I will definitely repurchase when I finish the current tube Highly recommend , Its a good product but I bought it mostly for the reason that it was a PEEL off mask but it actually wasnt unlike it said on the label So it worked well just needs better naming , I actually love it So my skin were really dry and I didnt wanna spend too much money for face masks every week so I bought it and its amazing it feels stinging at first because my skin was too dry but after a while the stinging feeling was gone and after I wash them off my skin were super soft the best part is that this is only 7 but over ten uses per tube and I love the smell Ive bought them three times and definitely still going to keep buying it in the future , I have acneprone skin that is often red and inflamed I love the tingling AND it smells A M A Z I N G Not only did this reduce redness it also has a really energizing scent pretty great price for what you get and what it does as well It doesnt take long and I used it on my back and it felt awesome because my shoulders were sore and the tingling helped , I really like this product my skin has been so itchy and acne prone this winter and I found this and decided to give it a try It makes my skin really smooth and feels so good when I put it on my face To add on Yes I did buy it because I thought it was a peel it off mask but Im happy with this as well It smells really good too , I loveddd this product it made my skin super soft refreshed however i thought it would be a peel off mask and i think they knew what they were doing naming it because thats why i bought it great product bad labeling , I love this 3 minute quick mask It makes my skin feel so refreshed and this mask gives it that glow , my daughter is loving this and says it is helping with blackhead The only downside is that I bought it as a peeloff mask and it does not do that One of the other reviews here clarified that it is peeling as in exfoliating which makes more sense but is definitely a source of confusion , I know it didnt peel but it was amazing I have a very oily face so it is super acne prone With acne comes red marks and this mask reduced that discoloration and left my skin feeling amazing Highly recommend , Definitely not a peel off mask if thats what you are looking for it is definitely skin perfecting  I notice a difference in my skin rougher after I use it  Leaves the skin feeling and looking baby soft , I really like this mask Afterward my skin felt really soft and refreshed But I didnt like that I had to scrub my face that hard to get it off , ITS NOT A PEEL OF MASK by peeling they mean like a chemical peel they should definitely be more clear about it being a peeling mask and not a peel off mask as i waited for to long for it to dry it takes ages to wash of and i would prefer an easy peel but it leaves my skin feeling smooth and cool , I love it it helps my skin a lot with my acne My skin is so soft after it , its not a peel off mack but if you read it all it says to rise it off so idk why everyone is upset  I enjoy it alot feels nice after I usually put a cream face eye afterwards feels great and smells good too , NOT a peel mask but it smells really nice and left my skin feeling very soft and refreshed Defintetly good for more than 5 uses as well For the price I think this is a nice mask but it doesnt peel , THIS IS NOT A PEEL OFF MASK They call it peeling as in a chemical peel If you look in the ingredients there is lactic acid which is a chemical exfoliator aka a chemical peeling ingredient It also says in the directions to wash it off not peel it off This mask smells great and my skin feels smooth and soft after using it Youll get more than 10 uses per tube so its definitely worth the price , I have very sensitive skin but this product is not irritating It made my skin feel happier and refreshed It doesnt peel off however the directions literally say to rinse after application so dont be put off Would recommend especially for quality and price , I was really excited to try the grapefruit one as Ive been wanting to try a peeling mask and grapefruit sounded like it would be really refreshing I was a little concerned about it being irritating Im always hesitant when it comes to citrus but Im not sure thats based in anything lol but it wasnt an issue at all for me The scent is really yummy but not strong and can only really be smelled when applying and washing off I would have enjoyed it if the smell lingered while wearing but its probably a good thing irritationsensitivitywise that it doesnt Another positive is the priceit says 5 uses but will definitely last longer I tried using more product the second time but it didnt make a differenceThe reason for only 2 stars is that this is NOT a peeling mask and it doesnt seem to do much of anything Ive used at least three times waiting different amounts of time using more or less product with and without water and no matter what it is impossible to massage the product or make it peel Usually peeling products combine with the oil on your skin and the product balls up gently removing dead skin cells But this mask dries so fast that it creates a rubbery film that wont budge peel or even rinse off without any sort of cleanser It has what feels like little exfoliating granules but they just sit on your face since you cant massage them around I even tried using as a scrub cleanser and it just slipped off and left the same rubbery film I also didnt notice any brightening or polishing effects unless the rubbery layer is supposed to be a polish Luckily it didnt irritate my skin except for the excessive scrubbingwashing or cause me to breakout Maybe those with oily skin will have better luckSo one star for price half a star for smell and half for not being irritating or causing breakouts , Misleading title it does not peel It does not dry in three minutes It was difficult to wash off because it was clear Just an overall bad product not worth 7 dollars , After over 30 minutes still cant peel it off  Its not still wet its like it partially absorbed into my skin leaving an oily residue that I will have to scrub off  Not pleasant , It says it sets in 3 min I waited 15 and it was still wet and unpeelable Because it was still wet my face got itchy I couldnt stand it any more so I went to rinse it off but it is so viscous it took awhile to get it off 9 for 5 applications and it doesnt work Rip off My skin feels nice enough but half of the reason I bought it was for the fun of the peel Im going to go get my money back , Quick and easy mask to use I love this It is so cheap and works great You apply it wait a while then when you wash it off your skin feels amazing You get more uses then it indicates so it is a great value Obsessed highly recommend"
Hemp Mousse Mask - Anti-Blemish,"Literally joined the online community just so I could write a review for this product It definitely is sheer when applying but trust me when I say that its still there and working It practically eliminates any blemishes I may have overnight and reduces redness I love this product so much that I typically buy several bottles at a time out of fear that theyll discontinue it So yeah you should definitely get this mask if youre on the fence about it , I received this as a gift I put it on and you couldnt even tell it was on unless you apply almost the entire bottle I saw no difference after using it Dont waste your money , Doesnt help at all and I never noticed a difference , makes my skin matte without drying it out softening and soothing great for redness the weed scent isnt overwhelming and the texture is nicea little goes a long way i bought one container of this in NOVEMBER and have been using it a couple times a month and its only half gone works really well as a spot treatment for acne as well as for the tzone or full facemy only criticism is that it doesnt work as well if you leave it on for the recommended time leave it on for half an hour longer if youre using it as a spot treatment , I thought this mask would help with pores but I do not see any difference  its sheer and it does not do anything for my face , Honestly this might be my favorite mask of all time I see a difference immediately in the redness and hydration of my skin and several of my blemishes are gone by the morning after using this mask PLEASE dont ever discontinue this , Nice to apply smells good and not too oily however did nothing for my skin after multiple uses over time , Basically its not doing anything special For me is good as a small procedure during working days , Very nice product Might be weed  Not sure Good for oily skin , Feels nice to apply and my skin feels nice enough afterward Its not a mousse at all though more like a lotion or cream and I really hate the smell of it I wouldnt mind if I just had to deal with it for 5 minutes while wearing the mask but the scent lingers on face and on hands even after washing with soap Volume of product for price is excellent Ill keep using till its gone but I wont repurchase this one , The perfume fragrance is way too strong it smelled as if id rubbed a bottle of perfume on my face The consistency is like lotion not a mousse I like the whole concept of cannabis infused skincare but i dont feel this was a well crafted product , This is a really nice and gentle mask that leaves my skin feeling very soft and hydrated I do however find the scent of it a little strong , I really wanted to like it As other reviewers have said its not foamy in texture Im not even sure if it does anything for my skin It just felt like I washed off a moisturiser Will not repurchase , Honestly I love it I bought it because it said anti blemish and was fairly priced Didnt really expect much But I use it so often and it says only 5 uses but I have gotten a few more out of it It makes my skin feel so soft and happy afterwards , The size is surprisingly small I shouldve checked the oz more carefully  but I felt like it did nothing and has a very strong smell , i LOVE this mask every time i have a blemish or red spot i use it and then wake up and its almost gone i definitely recommend this product and i am going to buy it again , I second everything the other ladies have been saying lotion like texture more uses than just 5  this mask is a nice addition to my bedtime routine Not only is it wallet friendly but it only advises you keep on for 5 minutes for it to work Easy to apply easy to wash off and very low impact for time I could even see myself using it in the morning if I had an important event  and I am NOT a morning person Overall this mask calmed my normal skin and had a nice mattifying effect Love the smell too , I bought this for a friend and never ended up giving it as a gift so I kept it for myself It smells mostly like pine And has a soft texture when rubbing it on your face It has WAY MORE uses than the bottle says and it makes my face glow after I use it Not bad for 7 if I may say so myself , I thankfully just received this today My supersensitive redness prone skin has not been handling the summer heat well Im talking about red splotches super warm to the touch skin Its not cute and its painful to boot I put a generous layer on my skin and my skin immediately felt cool And when I rinsed it off my skin was markedly less red Pretty impressive for a 5 minute mask I definitely would recommend this to anyone who has rosacea or rednessor anyone who just wants a quick indulgent experience I will be keeping this on hand , I was pleasantly surprised by this mask I have combosensitiveacne prone skin anything too harsh makes me dry and red and broken out This is very gentle mattifying and my pores looked smaller and smoother after removing Any active spots i had seemed smaller and less inflammed it calmed and tightened my skin for sure Its more of a lotion type mask which I think helps it to not overdry skin The smell is very nice like a hempy christmas tree reminded my of Sunday Rileys Saturn mask but without the hint of sulfur Honestly the smell is so nice I didnt want to remove it after the 5 mins Definitely worth the 7  , First of all it smells so nice It feels great on your skin the texture is so smooth Its a nice mask to have I notice my skin is getting better Im not sure if its from that but if I used it more Im sure it would be more of a difference You can also get a lot of usage out of it for a great price I would totally recommend this product , I really wanted to like this mask I use the Sephora face masks often and really enjoy them but this one leaves a weird residue no matter how many times I rinse and try to wipe it off Wah , This mask has a really interesting foaming texture out of the tube and it smells amazing There are 5 uses from the tube but I think there is actually more because you apply a thin layer and not thick where you cant see your skin My skin felt nice afterwards and I am looking forward to using this again , Bought this on a whim and I dont regret it As the other reviewer noted its not a mousse its fairly thin and almost lotionlike The lady at the store advised its good for about 7 uses but so far Ive used it about 15 times and have about half the tube left I put on 2 thin layers and leave it on for about 15 minutes I find its great for reducing redness and inflammation but Ive yet to see a reduction in overall blemishes My skin is oily and its less oily after usage but not completely matte Its slightly moisturizing so its great if youve accidentally over exfoliated as Im prone to do It works better if I incorporate it into my overall skin routine Also as a side note its suggested on the tube that you take a selfie for the Sephora collection but its fairly transparent and not apparent after about 2 minutes unless you glop it on For the price and what it actually does I think its worth a try Ill definitely buy more once Ive run out , I took off one star for the misleading description of this Mousse which is basically the same consistancy as lotion and not a foamy texture mask as the bottle claims It doesnt feel light and foamy like I expected when I saw Mousse Mask and its very thin If you dont really glob it on its basically like you just put moisturizer on your face My skin is neither excessively oily nor dry and I only have minor blemishes that pop up randomly After using this it didnt moisturize my face but it also didnt dry it out at all However it did make my skin super soft and it absorbed all of the oil that was on my face before I used it and totally mattified my face Im impressed with how soft and smooth my face feels now even hours later Also it has a hemp scent that is faint and pleasant not overwhelming at all and my nose is very sensitive I find the scent really relaxing A good mask to use at nighttime to prep for moisturizer while you unwind for bed I cant speak to whether it helps with acne because I dont have any right now but I didnt notice it really did anything for my pores thus farIts definitely worth 7 Id have given it 5 stars if it was actually the consistancy of a mousse and thick and creamy enough that you feel like youre wearing a mask instead of mousturizer If youre looking for a mask thatll soften your skin and wont hurt your pocketbook this mask is definitely worth a try"

smooth has a clear gel like texture and absorbs quickly has no fragrance and really locks in moisture well Its a bit richer than any regular hyaline Iv serum I have used before I use it daily in the morning and at night and I love it Will absolutely repurchase once I run out , I love this product I am in love with this This is a new musthave in my daily routine It absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling amazing I need all the hydration I can get living in a dry climate and this is skin savior , Gifted by Sephora Collection I didnt have high expectations for this serum but it left my skin feeling super plump and hydrated I initially used it after a long day at the beach and it left my skin so moisturized that you cannot tell it has been dried out all day before using it Since using it consistently my skin is now very soft to the touch and has a beautiful glow I have tried other brands that are triple the price but this product delivers at a fraction of the price only 20 My last point is that a little goes a long way I only need to use two to three drops and it covers my face and neck completely and fully , I really love this serum Its a beautiful hydrating product and its super affordable as well I love applying this on damp skin and topping with a moisturizer to lock everything in Highly recommend this one , This moisturizing serum is need more exposure Its so comfortable on my skin The texture easily absorb to my skin without sticky feeling and leaves my skin plump It has no scent which is greatThis serum helps my skin heals hydrated and well moisturized It also works well with my other skincare productsIts so affordable with an amazing results , It provides intense hydration to the skin leaving it feeling soft smooth and supple It has a lightweight texture which absorbs quickly and doesnt leave a sticky residue on the skin making it suitable for all skin types including oily and sensitive skin I love it , Ive been using this for a little while  Im loving it Seems a bit richer than a regular HA  still keeping me hydrated and smooth and for the price you really cannot beat it So far Im really enjoying it , I apply this serum after toning and before applying moisturizer The serum leaves my skin feeling hydrated and dewy I use it every night The serum absorbs quickly and does not feel tacky I can strongly recommend , I am always on the search for a serum that is going to get the job "
Illuminating Hydrator - Radiance + Smoothing,"Ive been using this product on and off for about 5 months and it leaves my skin with a smooth feeling Which I love It has a weird smell but that doesnt really matter much Its not glowy or anything but it sure does have a great touch I recommend it 910 , I have dryish skin and Im in my forties This cream makes my skin look soft Im a fan , It made my skin feel sticky and dry Like I wouldnt even use it in a pinch I threw it out after a week , This product is absolutely useless It doesnt hydrate as it claims to do I always need to applyi Nother layer of moisturizer to make sure my skin is hydrated After application it dries out your skin Wouldnt recommend it , Left my skin feeling super dry and broke me out Nothing illuminating about it , high quality and versatile product for a reasonable price i like using it layered on top of my morning moisturizer for a glowy look when i am not wearing makeup it is also my goto makeup primer i prefer it over the fentytarte primers that i used to use the makeup sticks very well and you still have a glowy look after using foundationconcealer i have very sensitive skin and this has not caused any irritation or breakouts theres not visible glittershimmer in the product its an opaque white colour which is what i was worried about when i read the reviews , Its like putting lotion on your face Theres nothing illuminating about it No shimmer shine or glow Provides some hydration but that is it , i received a sample of this completely unaware that the product contains a finebutintense pink shimmer similar to Physicians Formulas Ros All Day Serumbut after using it at night as a serum under my Cerave lotion not the cream  the cream might be too thick to do this with unless you have dry skin i was honestly impressed by how luminous my skin was the next morning i noticed that my postbreakout scars had improved quite a bit  even after washing so as to ensure that i wasnt merely being deceived by the shimmer i think its a great product that has been poorly marketed if it were marketed as a serum and if the label actually indicated ANYWHERE that it contains shimmer instead of merely describing the product as illuminating radiance  smoothing and brightening which can be interpreted in many different ways then i think many consumers would not be so disappointed for the record i have oilyflaky combo skin that tends to become congested , I have pretty oily skin and day creams turn me greasy This is the only lotion I can put on every morning and it absorbs within minutes and makes my skin feel supple soft and the pearlescent light reflecting bits are lovely not overpowering If you have dry skin this will not be heavy enough  Ih ave no idea what it would do for acne prone skin I am 41 and my aging skin is all about this I am on my third tube I tried a great variety of very expensive creams and lotions but this beats them all for day wear In fact is so amazing that I am giving them out as gifts to friends who I know have similar type of skin , I really enjoy this product I do not wear face makeup and I like that it gives me a little shimmer I put my sunscreen after this and its the perfect amount of moisture Not too greasy or oily I use this as a daytime moisturizer only , A no for me It doesnt moisturize and I did not see any tint I am sticking with the all day Sephora moisturizer for now , This isnt moisturizing It gives a pink tintshimmer but thats about it , Im about to hit 29 Im trying lots of moisturizers and serums to keep me youthful looking This one was an awkward lotion texture with a shimmer My fine lines under my eyes looked WORSE immediately and my tiny hormonal acne spots looked shiny like glitter Felt sticky on the face Nothing moisturizing about it , Sephora Illuminating hydrator is an okay product It does illuminate your face a little bit but it is not hydrating at all Consistency of product is good but on the other hand the smell is very awkward , I love this moisturizer has a little glow to it also , Ive bought it twice I find it very moisturizing and silky Dont break out  all Love it for price , this was pleasantly surprising Im usually really hesitant about anything illuminating aside from highlighter because the last thing I want is for a moisturizer to make me look ultra shiny I will say my skin feels very hydrated and has a glow that Ive seen with glossier super dew For a glowy look its really nice Its not matte but I dont mind using it day to day when I brought it on holiday , I really love this moisturizer It keeps my combo skin more towards drydehydrated side in winter feeling dewy all day long Some folks commented on the smell I think it just smells like rose oil Its one of my favourite moisturizers that doesnt break the bank , I was hoping to love this but I dont particularly like the texture or the smell It felt sticky when I put it on and didnt get much better , Gross pimple inducing formula It felt like hand lotion mixed with shimmer eyeshadow Has to be at least 40 shimmer very very fine shimmer ready to clog your pores gross , I received it as sample As first I felt rubber and sticky then it got better when I give a few minutes later I dont feel as this is moisturizer as all since I have a dry skin It does give facial illuminating However I think its best to use this product after serum if I receive another sample to try again , Seems fragranced not very moisturizing more illuminating but nothing to go on about in that department either No Just no , Been using it for a few weeks now I have clear skin that becomes dull after applying moisturizer Since my heart wouldnt let me spend more on glow boosters I decided to buy this one which fit my pocket It is light weight and is easily absorbed into my dry cheeks It adds a mild radiance and keeps my skin hydrated I like the feel of it and would buy again , It was just okay Illuminates skin and kinda meh in the moisturizing department Nothing to write home about but noting bad to say either Felt nice and was super light but did nothing to wow me , More of a glow primer than moisturizer It is not moisturizing enough for my combination dry skin The glow is natural and subtle but has a pink tint It layers under makeup okay , Im very pleased with how hydrating it is It has a thick consistency but absorbs so nicely into my skin leaving it smooth  soft and healthy It layers well under makeup but leaves a subtle sheen that looks actually quite nice , I usually love everything Sephora Collection but I just dont when it comes to this product Its the one item Ive purchased that I keep trying to use but I just hate The shine it leaves is due to actual glitter albeit microscopic sized that tends to clump in some areas The texture itself goes on smoothe but becomes clumpy when dry I have very sensitive skin and this stuff makes me hive randomly on my face causes my face to sweat and the texture itself becomes so clumpy from your face not soaking it up at all The scent is okay but obviously not consistent with the scent of the rest of the Sephora Collection line , Very subtle illumination which I appreciate  so many products designed to give you a glow just make you look sparkly or sweaty This doesntWorks well under makeup feels nice and light no skin troubles with it I probably wont purchase again just because my skin is pretty dry and needs more moisture than this But for someone who doesnt need quite as much this could be perfect , Received as a sample and it looked nice and dewy although not moisturizing at all I ended up with a horrible breakout , Im actually impressed that this product delivered decent moisture and left behind a very delicate pearl sheen on my skin  I wish it was more moisturizing but for the price its a very decent product  Gives u a wonderful glow immediately after but dries matte and I like a little more moisture  Love the sheen , I received this in a clean sample set and used as my evening moisturizer I have oily skin that is acne prone on my chin which hasnt broken out in several months While this was very hydrating the morning after use it felt like I still had a film on my skin and I had a breakout May work for others though , This is a light moisturizer that has a very light shimmershift to it it definitely works great under makeup and by itself I have oilycombo skin so is just the right amount of hydrating for me If you have dry to even normal skin this likely wont be hydrating enough for you , Good for dry skin does what it is supposed to Has a bit of illuminating effect which makes the skin look healthy  Havent tried under makeup yet but it probably would look add a natural highlighted effect , hydrates and not at all oily absorbs instantly i wear it under sunscreen but i dont see much radiance effect , Smells good and has a nice clean texture and absorbs well great day time lotion for normal to dry skin Would buy again , Really loved this UNTIL I saw in a magnifying mirror it covers your face in a pinky blue coloringweirdI would not have chosen this and wont buy it againI have liked everything from the Sephora brand so far so maybe I will end up liking this but I doubt it , I have very dry that becomes oily skin throughout the day This product hydrates my skin and gives it an amazing glow I love it , Very strong fragrance that made me wonder if the ingredients are actually considered clean When I asked about it in the shop they confirmed that the scents are created with natural ingredients but Im very sensitive so this did not end up being a good fit , I love it texture is awesome and is hydrating but doesnt break me out which is godsend , Leaves the skin very hidrated and shine Gives a glow to the skin , I wanted to love this so badly I applied it over moisturizer and applied extra in the places I wanted added glow This made my skin even more dehydrated I was shocked even with the ingredients I thought it was a fluke so I tried it combined with a few different products and yielded the same result If you have VERY dry skin just stick with something more emollient than this , Ive used this on all skin types and havent seen anything special about it It just feels like regular face lotion I dont see any smoothing or illuminating effects to it I really wanted to like it but unfortunately did not see the benefits , Its hydrating and illuminating but I find that I do have to use quite a bit of it to get that effect It doesnt have any fragrance but has that moringa oil smell its not strong and will dissipate after a while but its very grassy lol I find that it does absorb really fast and dries out which is also why I use plentiful when applyingSo not the best moisturizer but you get what you pay for , I have been using a lot of the products from this clean collection I love the hydrator and wanted to try this Its very light yet is moisturizing and gives you skin a nice glow i do use it as a primer and it seems to make my makeup wear longer , I have normal skin and this didnt moisturize my face enough Unlike other moisturizers Ive used my face soaks up this one completely even when I use a generous amount and I feel like I didnt put anything on my face at all It literally feels like I patted my face dryBut Ill give credit where its due It IS illuminatingradiant and it does give some sort of smoothing effect I do not think this worked as a hydrator for me though Maybe it would work better on someone else , I havent extremely dry skin and psoriasis as well I purchased this the other day while in store and so far im loving it it was a great consistency no scent and leaves my skin feeling soft For the price i love it"
Instant Masks,"It was very fragrant which was fine It didnt really peel off it kind of absorbed into my skin , Doesnt really do anything and is heavily scented Meh , let me just say this was awful I have normal skin and I dont break out from things like ever but the first time I used this it instantly burned my face I couldnt even leave it on for the 3 minutes it says to because it burned so badly It took a whole day for my face to go back to normal after using this At first it started tingling then instantly burned and made face red with blotches I will not buy this again , I love this mask It smells like grapefruit and does its job I use this once a week to brighten my skin and give it a little pep during winter months It goes on light It has tiny scrubbers in it as well Your face will tingle a smidge and feel a cool sensation Once done your face will feel squeaky clean without feeling dry and my skin is dry right now Good mask and budget friendly , This mask is very heavily scented with fragrance parfum and also contain talc which is known to cause irritation and some cancers 010 do not recommend , Absolutely love this mask and others from this line It really sucks that they will no longer be making them Ive  found it difficult to find masks that work well with my skin that dont dry it up or make me breakout more , Nothing special and smells like mens deodorant Skin feels the sam as before applying the mask , Smells really nice but does not go well with sensitive skin I did not notice any results when using this mask other than it making my cheeks irritated , the banana one is intensely nourishing  soothing it leaves my skin looking noticeably more moisturized I love it  such a great price , I love it soo much it has toned my skin sooo well Definitely gonna buy more and try the other ones as well , Drys nicely face feels clean goes on tingly and fresh expensive for amount you get though , My skin is always irritated and Ive used this to calm it down a few times , I was looking for masks that smell like banana and found these masks Unfortunately the banana one wasnt for the skin I have so I got the peppermint gum I honestly thought it just would have a cool peppermint feel but nope it legit feels like melted gum that you rub all over your face and yeah it does its job I guess I am not a fan of the cleanup since the consistency is so sticky I thought it was going to be a looooot bigger thats my bad for not reading the size It says 5 masks but I could get around 10 , Love it It does exactly what it claims One of my favorite Sephora collection products , Amazing and really good value I find it really helps minimize redness and stops the spread of acne when I have a breakout , Love love LOVE this stuff I use it right after a salicylic acid mask and it leaves my skin so plum and cool I keep it in my mini fridge and it makes a HUGE difference The only thing I dont like is that it leaves a tint on my fingers if I apply with my hand Other than that great product , Its really good I liked it The best feeling is when I washed my face and felt the coolness , Smells really good but I did not really notice a difference in my skin Maybe a little more refreshed , Not worth it Has a weird smell and doesnt do anythingdifficult to spread and has dry texture , Love this mask Felt refreshed after using it and my skin was glowing and radiant Definitely buying again only one thing is my skin is a bit sensitive so it burned a bit but I was fine  , I received this mask as a gift from a friend not long ago After 2 weeks the mask has started staining my face and it was really difficult to get off , The hemp mask minimized my pores but the only thing is it felt sticky other that great product , I usually love the smell of mint but this stuff smells really weird and synthetic The texture is very much like melted gum and difficult to wash off , Works wonderfully reducing redness from rosacea and from acne I use it 2 times a week , used as normal and seemed okay but it stained my face blue , This mask Peppermint Gum turned my application finger blue I was concerned after removing the mask if I would be joining the Blue Man Group or more of a low budget Tobias Fnke After peeling and rolling the mask off my face for 20 minutes  thankfully I was not blue da ba dee da ba di Overall it was exhausting to removed the mask with little to no skin improvement I will not be using the rest of the tube I couldnt even gift this to a friend with a clear conscious since I truly believe this to be a bad product , The peppermint gum mask felt nice on but was an absolute nightmare to remove Anywhere where the mask was even slightly too thick it was just wet and gummy Had to scrub the heck out of my skin to get it off AND it left behind a bit of a blueish tinge , Doesnt peel off and difficult to wash off I threw it away Definitely dont recommend , This product surprisingly lasts longer than expected I really enjoyed the gentle scrub Tip Dont leave it on your face longer than the product says The product works best in the suggested time and leave you feeling refreshed , I have both the banana  the mint mask There are so many better masks than these The banana one just barely moisturizes I like the smell but it doesnt do muchThe minty one smells nice and feels cool but does not peel off at all Its like rolling moist gum off your face Again I feel it doesnt do anything , I apparently dont learn this tube is MUCH smaller than expected Its kind of like a small tube of toothpaste Anyway I bought it because its wasnt too expensive I like the sweet smell of bananas and I was interested in trying a mask I tried it once for the sake of seeing if its worth suffering through the smell but nope the smell isnt sweet at all its more like that brown no longer showing any yellow banana smell that you decided to dry out on your porch in full sun for a week I can understand the appeal of true realistic smelling products but no just no not this one I showered while wearing it and breathed through my mouth so at least I was able to multitask I didnt really feel any improvement or anything at all afterwards It wasnt moisturizing or making my skin glow it was just there then washed off because of the size of the tube I guess the quantity needed per mask can be cheaper than buying individual masks but theres better out there I noticed red blemishes and raised spots on my chincheekjaw areas so I think it was too comedogenic and clogged my pores or irritated my sensitive skin it might be nice for those who have truly oily skin because I think it was probably a bit dryingAnyway I returned it pronto , Bought the Bannana  cream   nd it is the first time  I habe bought this type of product    and you know I like it    it makes my skin feel refreshed in some strange way     I enjoy this , I like that mask it is my second time buying it I usually do it before putting makeup and I always get complimented on my skin after , Definitely calming and has the scent you would expect left my skin feeling very smooth upon first application , This face mask had a pleasant smell and it left my skin hydrated smooth and shiny , Absolutely disappointed with this product I left it on as directed and it was not dry when I tried to take it off It was hard to take off and I was literally scrubbing my skin Gave up on it and tried to wash in warm water It was even messier Not purchasing this product again , great product worked really well and was very soothing , Absolutely adore the banana cream mask It smells like banana cream pie and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth What more could you ask , This mask smells delicious and feels incredible You apply it to a dry face and let it sit for 510 minutes and rinse off It isnt harsh and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft Its great for most skin types and is super affordable The banana scent is really nice and not artificial at all , This review is for the Peppermint Gum mask  It smells nice but is not overpowering  I felt that it left my skin smoother and softer  The only issue is that it says its a peel off mask  IT DOES NOT PEEL OFF  I still had to gently wipe it off with a wet cloth , This face mask smells so good I left it on for a few minutes longer and my face felt great I will purchase again , Fun Green Mask It doesnt have CBD or anything but I still enjoyed it Skin feels great afterward , My review is based on the nourishing banana mask This mask is really affordable easy to apply and rinse off and has a very pleasant and surprisingly not artificial banana smell My skin is oily and whenever I use this mask my skin feels soft and clean after use I could see it being suitable for most if not all skin types However if youre looking for some kind of miracle mask or dislike bananas I would probably look elsewhere as while it is a nice mask you get what you pay for and its a pretty standard formula , I bought this in the Sephora store and was so exited to use it Once I put it on and used it as directed on the package when I went to peel it off it was still completely wet The package said leave for 3 minutes so I did but it hadnt dried yet so I left it for 20 more minutes and still it hadnt dried I am somewhat disappointed that it didnt do what it was supposed to do only good thing was that my skin felt a little smoother after applying Dont waste your money on this specific product maybe opt for something different , I really like this mask Maybe not the best one but it smells really good and I feel my skin more hydrated , I bought before and it was amazing smelled great felt amazing The formula must have changed now its thick and smells like a drugstore face mask Might not buy again , As other commenters mentioned I feel like the sales associate misunderstood me when I said I was looking for a peel off mask This is a mild chemical exfoliant mask using fruit enzymes Citric acid and lactic acid However these ingredients are quite far down the list which is probably why it doesnt give you the strongest exfoliation effect Those calling it a scrub are wrong although the packaging and instructions could have been more clear Its not life changing by any means but for 11 its not bad for a VERY mild exfoliation , it works really well and leaves my skin feeling soft it had a slight stinging feeling which surprised me but I do have sensitive skin Overall it is a nice thing to add to my skincare routine 3 times a week , This is really a great mask I use the banana cream mask about twice a week and it leaves my dry skin hydrated and super soft , the hemp mask is by far my favorite first it smells AMAZING it has a great texture very light too i have combination skin and when i want to make a quick mask before my makeup this one is perfect my skin feels refreshed and softer after , The banana mask is my new favorite  It leaves my skin feeling replenished after harsh winter weather  The scent is definitely banana but not overwhelming  Ill be buying more , I went in person to the Sephora stores and I got it my skin was a little irritated by it Dont Recommend if you have sensitive skin , I dont know if its just the oat one but its very slimy and has a weird smell Its not the easiest to get off either , Very lightweight and the scent is very subtle  I love it and would 100 order it again  It leaves my skin extremely nourished and it feels so moisturized after I use it , My skin is so hydrated after onetime use And peppermint mask has a mild cooling and calming effect which I like after exfoliating my skin But I dont like the peeling part of it Like I have to rub my skin to remove the mask which I dont like it being a sensitive skin person , The oat muesli mask has a lot of bang for your buck Especially during the winter cold months i use this about 12 times a week to baby my skin a bit It really does help in soothing dry skin and even diminished some red irritation spots Definitely worth it and it wont break the bank , Jai test le masque  la banane et je laime bien Ma peau tait plus lisse plus belle , It says only good for 5 uses but I managed to stretch this product for more uses A think layer and 10 minute wait is all you need It stopped my blackheads from coming in which was a big issue for me Leaves my face soft and clean , I hate to be negative but it took forever for me to get this mask off It was just a mess I was extremely disappointed in this whole mask line , I got the hemp one and it is decent After one use i did notice my face was softer The smell is unpleasant to me its sort of strong Also the texture makes it really hard to layer the mask to get a decent application , Do not buy this product It says peel mask which is not the case , Pretty good for the price I had the grapefruit and hemp masks and they both made my skin super soft and refreshed Plus they lasted way more than 5 uses probably around 1520 for each Super great results and great price , I absolutely hate the smell of this stuff  It smells extremely artificialBut it does make my skin pretty soft , Love the oat one Leaves face smooth and bright  love to use it in the morning before starting the day , I have combination skin that tends to be on the move sensitive side This mask was really soothing and helped calm my faces redness My face instantly felt softer , not a fan too sticky and burns Use an applicator as the product will stain hands , This stufff is amazing It worked soo well and smelled amazing , It dyed my face blue  I mean my skin feels softbut its blue so I cant reccomend , The oat mask was really good for my dry skin and I love it It helped moisturize it and felt like it was ok for my redness not a big difference but it was soothing , Didnt really do anything and it smelled funky and strong Wouldnt buy again , it was okay but I found it didnt do anything and it made my skin burn a little I used the pink one , The oat mask has really helped me when I get a sunburn on my face and need to soothe my skin  The other masks though not so much I havent really noticed them doing what the promised and Ive tried all but the banana and the peppermint  If youre going to get one of these definitely get the oat because it really comes in handy , I loved this peppermint gum mask but my only issue with it is that it stains my skin this blueish green color after i take it off , I am a lover of all things Hemp related when it comes to skincare When I saw that Sephora had a hemp mask I was lit up with excitement and immediately purchasedThe smell is truly delightful to the senses It has a light green smell that is not too overpowering but subtle enough to notice The consistency is a little weird and ended up being a little bit too runny to be considered mousselike almost like kids slime goop nonsticky style This can be bothersome to some especially if you have sensory issues As far as whether or not the product is efficient enough to use and help with hydration it didnt really make much of a difference aside from making my skin a tiny bit softer than usual Still a good product though Four stars instead of five due to the consistency of the product , Smells great feels great and goes on thinly and not cakey Im usually more of a peel off mask gal but this stuff is awesome , I really liked the grapefruit mask so I was looking forward to the peppermint option The application felt and smelled like applying Elmers glue to my face which wasnt entirely unpleasant Removing the mask was really difficult and I had to roll pretty aggressively to get it off which took a while Once it was off I didnt notice any immediate results but my face was tinted slightly bluegreen After two washes with my usual face wash my face sink and mask applicator were still vaguely turquoise I had to steam my face and apply Herbivores Prisim peel to return to my usual colour , Been looking for a good oatmeal mask for my acne prone skin I like how soft my skin feels after using , I definitely used this mask more than 5 times This is a great mask I use it if I need my skin to be calmed Meaning if I feel like my skin is irritated or itchy Ill put this mask on and Ill feel fine , my sister bought this and used it once a week until she finished the entire tube she said it was okay but not the best clay mask she has used She didnt notice too much difference with her skin after a month of using this but she did appreciate the price wasnt too crazy , so i tried the grapefruit peeling mask and it does NOT peel i tried using different amounts of the substance but it still didnt peel and even after washing my face off and using a face wash there was still a unsettling residue , After a cleanser I put on some of the grapefruit mask and left it on for 5 minutes After it started stinging a bit so I washed it off I couldnt do the rest of my routine because my skin was red and sore afterwards and after contact with other product Murad acne cream this fact was simply made worse , I really like this peel I bought it on a lark and have not regretted it Really leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated I use it twice a week , has a lot of plastics and fragrance in it I was disappointed that the beads were plastic I dont have sensitive skin at all really yet I broke out There are way better options for your face and the environment , I really like the oatmeal mask It smells amazing and works well to moisturize your skin I can tell a difference after using it Great price too , Refreshing and appealing minute fragrance The color could develop further It only takes five minutes , Nice feel to it Easy rinse Brightening effectIt dries quickly on your face , Banana smell is really natural and no overpowering makes my skin glowy and doesnt burn as much as other masks i have very sensitive skin , This is a chemical peeling mask not a peel off mask The instructions for the mask make that quite clear It has AHA lactic acid in an unknown percentage but enough that it can cause some skin sensitivity issues and damage your moisture barrier if left on for too long There is some physical exfoliation but not enough to really do anything Ive used it 5 times and its about half way done Its easy to wash off in the shower with just water Leaves your face super smooth and bright There are way too many 1 star reviews from people who cant be bothered to read the instructions It says to wash off the mask not peel it off  Dont be discouraged from all the negativity Its a good cheap mask that does the job if youre on a budget , I liked the mask it was overall good except the smell was strong , Terrible Did absolutely nothing Just smelled of bananas , It smells like burnt rubber I kept it on for the sake of trying it out for the first time it was rough given the scent Would not recommend , great mask Skin is super smooth and glowing after , affordable masking am I 100 pimple free thanks to this mask no But its a nice addition to the skincare routine , Great mask with good price Easy to remove and feels great on and makes skin feel so soft but not any long term results , I bought this on a whim It has a cooling feeling which is nice Its a creamy thick face mask and it was an unusual scent but its not overpowering I recommend , This didnt do much to help face but it smells nice , It worked well easy to put on and made my face feel good , Purchased the Oat Muesli mask  I Love It  Living in the desert my skin has been feeling so dry and uncomfortable  after one use my skin was hydrated  supple  , I love this mask so much it comes with lots of it and it does wonders for your skin , This mask the mint one is terrible I tried to love it but there are too many things wrong with it To start when you push the product out it comes out thin and goopier than I was expecting I applied it with a silicone mask brush and it was difficult to get to stick and just felt gross applying Next the smell ew To say the least gross it smells like paint thinner or a weird window paint I REPEAT it does not smell like mint at all Maybe if you quickly inhale its there If it smells that bad i dont want that on my skin , I really like this mask it smells pretty okayand makes your skin glow , Ive tried the oat banana and acai masks and I feel that theyre all pretty much the same They do feel nice and cooling on my skin but I dont notice a huge difference in my skin after using them They are easy and fun to use so I think theyre worth the price but if you are looking for incredible results I wouldnt buy these , wasnt the best mask i have bought from here overall great exfoliation and amazing smell application and removal was more difficult then expected saw no immediate change in skin , Ive been using the banana mask and its fine but nothing special The smell with bring any 80s baby back to their childhood of penicillin better known as the banana medicine Its easy to apply dries quickly and is a bit oily I have dry extraordinarily sensitive skin and this works for me but someone with oily skin might want to think again Its nonoffensive and hasnt caused me problems so Ill continue to use it but wont repurchase when its gone as Ive noticed not one change after usage I will say there are easily 10 masks per tube not just the five listed , I have tried the hemp and oatmeal masks Both seem quite nourishing for my skin which is usually dry I like the smell of the oatmeal one more its very soothing , this mask is amazing i was a little skeptical because it was a peeloff mask but when i used it i found out that it didnt even peel i washed it off and then my face felt great it does have some bad ingredients but sooo worth it , DO NOT BUY PEPPERMINT GUM MASK After 10 minutes of having this product on my skin like instructed it stained my face blue My finger is also blue from applying it , I love this mask I feel so clean and fresh after I use it I love the tingly minty feeling too , Smells good Very creamy and soft It has a little scrub kind particles  Overall good for that price , Amazing smooth skin after washing off The real pieces of oats works great as a scrub and leaving a skin clean and milky texture Love this product , I dont know how some people complain about the smell of it If you dont like its fruity flavoured smell then why did you buy it in the first place lol  The bottle said 5 uses but Im sure it can last at least 10 uses My face feels fresh and clean afterwards However bare in mind that its only 10 mask not 100 so you get what you paid for , its fine it doesnt really do much as a mask and its definitely not a peeling mask its an ok exfoliating scrub though , Purchased for my daughter who is experiencing some minor teenage acne She loved and said her skin felt so soft after She wants me to purchase more masks from this line , I bought this as my daughters and I were starting to do spa nights  The smell is like bad toothpaste it is just awful  There is some tingle as it sits on the skin  I didnt notice any particular effect from the mask  Would absolute not recommend , Not what I was expecting Take forever to dry and peel ended up washing it off Didnt really do anything for my skin , fun but didnt do anything noticeable Smelled nice though , This mask smell so nice and left my skin very soft , I bought this on a whim and I am pleasantly surprised and satisfied I use this when my skin is feeling dehydrated and dry Skin is noticeably softer and more hydrated after just a single use Smells good 810 would recommend , Fresh on my skin love it  does some king of scrub when washing off , I dont see any difference after using the product on top of that it was a little difficult to wash it off I deep cleanse after using it and still find some residues of green when I wipe it with cleansing water , this product is amazing my skin felt really good after using it It also wasnt to expensive , The SMELL Oh my Goddess Unbelievably great smelling if you like bananas and my sensitive skin likes it after all redness is always gone , it feels so nice and works wonders it feels so nice on ur skin and really helped me and still does with any breakouts , If you bought this in store dont expect it to feel like the gummy way it does when they show you the sample of how it feels Was good to my face though and made it less dry , not going to lie I though this was a gummy mask but it was just a messy mask in a small tub I did very little for my face sadly , I really liked this mask Had an amazing scent If you are not into scented face masks or products I wouldnt recommend it Made my skin feel very soft and smooth after using it Not sure why its called a peeling mask doesnt actually peel off , My skin has been unusually oily during isolation and this mask has been amazing It dries out the oily spots nicely but doesnt dry out the rest of my face too much Its also very gentle on my sensitive skin I put it on fairly thin so Ive been able to get several uses out of this small tube Its great value for the price and I will definitely be buying it again , This mask has a pretty strong scent but it isnt the greatest think peppermint but somehow muted and gluelike The process of taking this mask off is as some others have mentioned unpleasant It does not peel off in pieces as you have to either roll it off in clumps or spend a while washing it off It DOES however feel cooling but is lackluster when it comes to how it tonesOther versions of these masks are amazing and effective  I highly suggest the Oatmeal  and Aai versions , I was a bit worried about buying the Oat Muesli mask because I have oily skin and it is hydrating But it sounded really nice and soothing for a lil skin tlc day so I just got it cause it was 6 I put it on on one of my off skin days where my skin looks a bit red and not that great It felt really nice on my skin like really soothing and relaxing It has a natural smell I enjoy those kinda smells but if you dont it might be kinda funky to you Anyway my face looked better after and it was cheap and felt super nice on Nothing too special but for 6 its a nice lil treat for ur face , I enjoyed the texture of the mask and the amount of product for the price point However the smell was very overpowering and a little nauseating The color also was a little difficult to remove and left a slight green tint Not my favorite of the Sephora masks , Oat mask  smells sweet I personally liked it My skin felt nice during and after I washed it off Its a treat mask that provides shortterm soothed skin but not a miracle worker I dont recommend this to anyone who does not like a fragranced mask , I bought it on a whim and I dont regret it My skin always feels soft and hydrated after using this mask my blemishes arent as visible now Although the smell isnt my favorite , If you love the smell of bananas youll love this product It states its supposed to be hydrating but I end up feeling a little dried out after using it but enjoy the smell the entire time , It is a very mild peeling and if you dont leave it for at least 5min you wont feel any difference I wouldnt recommend this if youre looking for a peeling effect as it does not do much BUT if you want a soft and even skin this works wonders and lasts quite a while I got 10 uses out of it , Smelled great but my skin burned after using it and broke out Would not reccomend for sensitive acneprone skin , This is amazing Smells exactly like bananas and its so refreshing , I was confused when my mask arrived since it said Grapefruit peeling mask but its no at all a peeling mask Its a gellike mask that you have to wash off after It made my skin tingle and made it super soft and glowy Its a good mask to use when youre bored but its good for only 8 , this literally doesnt peel at all it smells terrible and its extremely sticky , Its Okay It did make my face feel good after I do really like it , These masks are really cute and fun but I dont feel that they do anything for my skin Ive tried the banana one the aai and also the oat The banana one smells awesome and made my skin soft but the oat  aai ones I didnt like the smell of at all I also felt like whenever I used them they were just sitting on my skin not really doing much and the texture is kind of goopy I kept the banana one because I like the smell but I had to return the other 2 For the price these arent bad they would make cute gifts but if you want a mask that actually benefits your skin and isnt just for fun then look elsewhere because this pretty much does nothing , this mask does not peelyou put it on then wash it off didnt feel a thing not worth it , I got the hemp mousse and yes its gellike mousse It worked great on most areas of my face but it is NOT Malassezia safe I will recommend it to anyone who wants an antiimperfection mask that wont dry them out but if you have seb dermatitis then either steer clear or use with caution , This was a major disappointment It does not peel It did smell nice though , This mask has an issue in the recipe  It feels great it is good for sensitive skin but it stains green  I wish this was color free and I would use it again disappointed , Not a peel mask but I absolutely love it anyway Made my skin very fresh clean and smooth afterwards , This product was not what I thought it would be I thought it would be peeling because thats what it said it was but it didnt peel Other than that I lived everything else about it Although the scent was really strong it was still a good smell It really helps with any acne and just makes your face overall bright and healthy , Mask doesnt peel off not thick enough I dont mind because it has helped my breaking out and Ive only been using it for a week It does not burn my skin , This mask has a STRONG smell that is not very pleasing It is pretty chunky I would not buy this one but I tried all the others and the rest are SO GOOD , This is my favorite mask So glad to order it definitely clear my face up instantly , didnt really do anything and misleading when they say peel , Daughter used the green mint mask and "

Large Supplement Case,"I got the pink one first to keep in my work bag and decided to try out this one for my purse and for travel The clasps as sturdy and close well so nothing falls out overall Im impressed with this case , This is going back I bought the pink supplement case last year and use it for my vitaminssupplements when I travel I think the pink one holds the same amount if not more , Love it I prefer to eat when I take my supplements and sometimes that means taking them on my lunch break at work  this is perfect to drop in my purse on the days I forget or need to take them on my lunch break , Fits all my stuff latches well and fits perfectly in my bad I love this and its exactly what I expected it to be , Bigger than the pink version but still very small I returned it , Terrible product looks like it has been is storage for over a decade filled with stains and dark spots definitely not going to use it , I have a literal pharmacy of medication I have to cart about wherever I go  This handy little gadget is awesome  GONE are the days of random bottles spilling everywhere while you try to get out the one med you actually need at that time  I can separate my rxs into 6 neat categories  Each compartment has its own separate snapshut lid  The whole case snaps shut as shown This is a huge plus because no more meds getting all jumbled about   Everything stays organized and tidy in the separate section you left it inIm showing a Sephora lipgloss cosmic purple in the case so you can gauge the sizeI love this box  Thank you , This is a nice case for vitamins and supplements My only complaint is that for to use it daily there should be 7 compartments instead of only 6 Overall the compartments are able to hold my huge daily vitamins which I appreciate , The best design of this product yet My smaller one broke in half trying to open on of its compartments This iteration has much better handles and latches And better for travel since its bigger but still smaller than bringing multiple bottles of supplements 5 stars for now but always open to more iterations  , love it the only thing i didnt like about the smaller pink version was how awkward some of the compartments were i like how even though this double the size it is thinner i love the groves to open up the compartments as well , Sturdy case alittle over 4 12 in long 3 in wide and about an 1 in thick Rubberized texture on outside with plastic snap No mirror and all compartments on bottom only"
Lip Sleeping Mask,"The scent is debatable but I love the way it feels on my lips right after the application and in the morning after Also doubles up as a lip gloss for me when I want a natural but a little shiny lip finish , A strange green growth started growing on my lips after the second night of using so please be careful otherwise great product , After my application of the strawberry product my lips feel refreshed It sits very nicely on the skin like a light hydrating cream of sorts and it has a subtle strawberry scent , Its not too sticky or light just the right consistency I wouldnt say it has helped my lips stay moisturized the next day it just helps keep my lips from drying up through the night , smells nice but its grainy and you have to really rub it in so the grains go away By the time the grains are gone it will be time to reapply , I bought the strawberry version and after about 7 minutes the product dried out and I needed another product to actually hydrate my my lips , This dried my lips within minutes and at first it seems nice because it was glossy and had a nice scent but no , I really didnt like this product This product smells like fake strawberry is very thin and sticky and tastes like chemicals It didnt do anything for my lips , My lips have been super dry and cracky since being pregnant I decided to try some lip masks out and I got the Vanilla  Coconut Sephora lip masks I actually really enjoy them Theyre more like a gloss than a mask but I dont mind it before I go to bed , I use this product since like 3 weeks and I dont like the texture I would not call this a sleeping mask for lips because this product do not hydrated my lips , The Sephora lip sleeping mask isnt great The texture is silky but a bit too watery for my preference of sleeping mask I also found it dried it quickly on my lips Ill still keep it in rotation though The scent is lovely , This lip sleeping mask feels great on my lips but sadly doesnt smell good at all It kind of smells like playdough and would rather another scent , Its so hydrating and it smells sooooo good its worth the price , I got the Vanilla and it smells as you would expect I like my lip masks to be more thick and this is very very thin You need very little and it spreads nicely Its almost like i put on a mix of coconut oil with very little va saline not much moisture in my lips when using so i think its more of a subtle chapstick type , smells really nice and is very smooth great for the price , So good and it stays on your lips for so long def recommend , This is an affordable option for Laneige lip balm It is moisturizing I gave it  2 stars because you have to apply it with your finger Thats a nogo for me , Ive been using this product for about a week and a half and I love it It is a little bit thinner than Laneige but still pretty hydrating I also love how they also have different flavors during different times of the year The price is very reasonable I totally recommend this product , I was hoping to find a nice alternative to Lanege but this fell very short Its goopy and only sits on top of my lips without hydrating overnight The scent in the tube is good but when on the lips it is chemically and has a funky taste that migrates to the mouth Ill be taking it back next time Im at the store Im better off with chapstick and Vaseline on top like I have been since I ran out of Lanege , its good at first but over time i noticed it was staring to make my lips really chapped and it also tastes a bit funny but it looks really pretty on the lips , It is amazing for the price I would say linage DUPE , This isnt a bad product but I wouldnt compare it to a Laniege lip mask I feel like other lip mask are fast acting Like I can feel my lips moisturizing instantly as soon as I put them on whereas with this I feel like I have to give it 510minutes before I feel it hydrating my lips I agree its more of a lip balmlip oil It may soften the softer layer of skin on the lips but I dont think it penetrates deeper for a long lasting effect Its a nice lightweight product for its price but I wouldnt go out of my way to recommend it to anyone It doesnt have a flavor and the fragrance isnt pungent either If youre someone who thinks lip oils arent thick enough to hydrate your lips and you want something a little heavier than an oil this is a nice half step up , Worked great in terms of healing my chapped lips but left oil stains on my pillow case Only new thing I added to my skincare routine so I know it was this product Stains were there even after washing washipillowcases , My item arrived with the silver protector half opened so extremely disappointed It smells really nice and light Im hesitant to order another one , I live in Alaska and the winter is cold My lips got very dryflaky and pealed I ordered a few ones and got this one at the store while I waited for my order Well this product works great My lips healed and now I use it every time I take walks and hikes It dries a little quick but man thats ok I reapply , Its just ok The smell reminded me of playdoh not vanilla The mask also dries in around 5 minutes and even though its 5 I dont think its worth your money , This burned my lips horribly It smells and tastes good not that you should be tasting it But it ruined my lips and the moisture in them very fast I have actual burns similar to getting your brows waxed with wax that is too hot , Horrible made my lips so dry and cracked It is quite the opposite for moisturizing Regret buying it , Tried it was hoping for a cheap alternative to my sleeping lip mask I love but this is not the one The texture is just off and the smell reminded me of play dough  just a big no , Amazing cant go to sleep without putting this Lip Mask before  , I use this product every night before bed I always wake up with soft lips , I love applying this lipmask everyday It also looks great on the lips that i use it as a lipgloss sometimes too Outstanding results to my dry lips that are now always hydrated Would def buy agian , I love this lip mask I bought it because the laniege one was out of stock My lips were so dry and this made them hydrated again for sure , I got the strawberry one At first I didnt like how dry it left my lips but as I keep using it my lips get used to it and are less dry than before Not very pigmented the smell isnt the worst and the taste is decent  My only real complaint is that the application method is bad Would I buy again Most likely , Favourite lip mask I love the smell and it lasts all night , I have very dry lips so I was excited to try this Unfortunately it doesnt last all night for me unless I top it off with Vaseline The smell is nice and I do like the way it feels when its on , Felt nice when I put it on smells nicehowever lips still dry when I wake up in the morning , After using the product it just felt like scented Vaseline , This product is disgusting It tastes like Play Doh If you want to make a lip product make it taste good at least The texture is gross and feels like expired Vaseline The packaging is so annoying cause you have to put it on ur finger if you want to apply it Couldnt they have included an applicator , Just purchased this as a cheaper lip mask alternative and I really dont enjoy the tastescent Reminds me of playdough , This balm is pretty meh its a decent enough backup but I absolutely never reach for it There are cheaper drugstorehealth food store balms that are much better in my opinion Was a bit disappointed would be nice to have an alternative to some of the pricier options but this aint it , bought these for a Christmas game where people get to steal from each other Every one was fighting in a joking way over these I bought 2 , I love this product so much Its makes my lips so moisturized and soft Would definitely repurchase , It does absolutely nothing I have very dry lips especially in the winter and when I put this on it somehow feels dryer It just sits on top of the skin Better to use Vaseline , I love a good lip care product and this is amazing  I put this on after using a lip scrub and leave it on overnight and in the morning my lips feel wonderful Also the scent is very subtle and I appreciate that , I have the gingerbread and Im absolutely obsessed I use it all the time not just at night It gives my lips such a pretty gloss but not glossy in an annoying way Make more colors please , Loved so much I bought as stocking stuffer for others because of the great pricebeen using for about 2 months  Its great waking up without dry lips  I even forget about chapstick for a few hours in the daysmells great great price will get the coconut one next , This product seemed like it was working at first at the expense of the very oily texture and the bad taste However these soft lips didnt last Within days of use my lips become extremely painful and dry As I live in a dry climate I thought it was something else and upped the use Eventually they it became so painful I stopped the use After a day of not wearing my lips were back to normal and free of pain , Jadoreee cest mon nouveau produit pour les levre je le porte comme gloss aussi  , I used it and it left my lips so soft and plump Full to the brim definitely worth you money smells ok not my favorite but loved the product , Love the way it feels and smells especially bc I know its a clean product , I dont think you can get a better lip mask for this price It is incredibly hydrating and protective and stays on the lips pretty well The texture can feel a little sticky but I dont mind it I can hardly tell the difference between this and my Laneige lip masks The texture is much different but the results are pretty much the same The tube dispenser is convenient and more sanitary than a tubjar The only downside is that you might need to squeeze the tube around a bit or shake it so it doesnt come out too oily I keep one of these in every room I swear lol , A pretty nice lip mask Keeps lips soft overnight well Its exactly what I was looking for and a great price , After using this product I absolutely had to write a review This stuff is AMAZING for the price I use it every night and my lips that are usually miserably chapped and peeling during the winter months are as smooth as they have ever been This stuff feels amazing on and smells delightful Absolutely recommend , i love this lip mask and would definitely recommend it , Unfortunately this mask wont stay on for long saw no difference , This product works well it is lightly scented and lasts throughout the night It needs a different type of applicator at the area you apply it on your lips  it does not have a smooth surface so its not super comfortable to apply Other than that it works well and I like the scent , I blind bought this on a whim It is moisturizing and a similar consistency to the Laniege one this much is true But the other person here that says the vanilla one smells exactly like playdoh is spot on In fact I came to the reviews to see if anyone else had thought that after the first time I tried it It is an okay mask but again playdoh smell , I usually have dry lips and cracking on the edge that is pretty painful and annoying especially in the winter I apply this before I go to bed and I havent gotten any cracking since then also reduce the times I need to use a lip balm It really hydrates the lips The vanilla smell is pleasant not strong I personally think its worth it with the price I just use a little bit everytime which I think is enough , Made my lips soft And a lot of product for such little price Definitely recommend if youre just trying to find cheap glosses and lip masks that work well , Horrible Smells like play dough and makes your lips dry , This will make lips soft but the taste is very bitter , Super thick and hydrating Amazing scent and stays on my lips for a long time Reminds me of the summer fridays balm but wayyyy cheaper , It moisturizes the lips but you have to put a lot , It makes your lips super soft when you wake up and feels very hydrating I love this product , I LOVE this My lips are always chapped and in the winter they get so bad I wake from them and often they are bleeding This does EXACTLY what I was hoping for You put it on your finger and apply liberally before bed Yes it feels like it isnt going to soak in Dont worry it is but this is the mask part It stays on your lips for most of the night When I wake up my lips feel softer than ever A bonus my mouth doesnt feel quite as dry in the morning either I thought that was a coincidence until I forgot to apply a few times It doesnt have a strong flavour but the flavour it does have is yummy I went from never using lip masks to never wanting to go without one again , My lips are super dry and uncomfortable from having electric heating my apartment I decided to go the higher end route getting this lip mask and even a lip balm from Sephora Yeah if I could go back in time I would warn myself not waste the money This mask is useless I tried it for a week every night making it part of my bedtime routine It smells okay but its super sticky like a lip gloss no matter how little you put on It kinda just sat on my lips most of the night which was equally uncomfortable because I was worried about getting it on my pillow Anyways woke up in the morning the mask is absorbed My lips are still absolutely dry and uncomfortable If I could I would give this zero stars because its really useless It did nothing for me So yeah will NOT buy again , Loving the moisture factor in this lip mask but I feel like I need to warn everyone that the vanilla one smells exactly like play dough , ive been using this for maybe 2ish weeks and for someone whos obsessed with lip products this worked really well the flavor is subtle and feels great on your lips the applicator is not the best to use because its not like a regular lip gloss applicator if you know what i mean , Somehow made my lips more dry I regret buying this , Since getting fillers my lips have been so dry and rough Ive tried lip oils laneige and fresh This lip mask has been the most moisturizing and smoothing  Doesnt transfer absorbs well , got this as a gift I use it a lot in the winter when my lips start peeling I wake up with moderately dry lips it does make me break out around the mouth its worth the price ask Im not gonna spend over 10 on a lip mask , I have been using this for a couple weeks Its great for the price My lips have definitely looked softer and fuller , Worked temporarily but my lips were more dry after , I have used this product twice and it completely fixed my dry and peeling lips After the first night my lips were 75 better and after the second night they were completely repaired I look forward to using this every night to keep my lips silky smooth , This is honestly a dupe for the laneige lip sleeping mask I love how clean the ingredients are for this lip sleeping mask and it leaves my lips so soft and moisturizer My holy grail , when you first put it on it feels great but it totally dried my lips out i dont recommend this product , Very moisturizing and it smells really good Makes my lips feel very hydrated , began using this because other lip masks could cost upwards of 20 and it seemed impractical to me  i love this one so much the vanilla has to be my favorite scent but strawberry smells pretty nice too i apply this nightly as a part of my skincare routine and i wake up with moisturized and slightly plumped lips i read other reviewers and notice that they tend to misinterpret the product its an overnight mask not to be used during the day anyways i highly recommend this not just as a dupe for laneige or ilia lip masks but i actually prefer this over theirs , I have never in my life left a review for anything but this lip mask is so good that I needed to finally do itI have had chronically peeling lips for years not just in the winter but all yearround and no amount of chapstick could change that I bought this lip mask just so I could get free shipping on my Sephora birthday gift and WOW I had no idea what a benefit it would be As soon as I started using this my lips stopped peeling I woke up for the first time in years with smooth soft lips and now I know I will be using it for life , Not just for nightWhenever you need a moisture pick me up its great , Ever since I got this lip balm every morning I wake up my lips feel smoother and smoother I definitely recommend this product , I was on the hunt for a lip mask similar to pca skin lip mask  this is pretty similar to it plus I like this cause its scented  plumps up your lips like a lip plumper does  sephora collection has awesome products dont sleep on this , I actually really love this product I was looking for something to keep the creases of my lips from cracking when I wake up in the morning and so far this has kept it from happening It feels great not too heavy and stays on all night I dont really use it during the day but it is great for overnight , I love the coconut flavor of this product so I ordered the strawberry and I am very dissatisfied There is some sort of grit in the formula that is making the consistency almost like a lip scrub which is making the product virtually useless as a lip mask , I love using this Lip Sleeping Mask It makes my lips so smooth and pretty , Not my favourite product Basically just oil and has no applicator to it at all The scent is also barely there and not the best anyway Overall I probably wouldnt purchase again , Its a good price but it is so frangranced I prefer the laneige lip mask for sure , I usually use laneige lip sleep mask and love it Was hoping for a lesser priced alternative and this did not nearly work as well I woke up with dry lips every morning after applying the night before Laneige I wake up with soft lips and can still feel some remaining product by morning time , Not the worst thing ever but it tastes like play doh , i only used this for about a week but i stopped because i cant stand the taste of it works decently but would not buy again because of the bad taste , I love the texture Keep lips soft and smooth I use it every night before go to bed , It makes my lips feel nice and soft in the morning but consistency is very liquidy and drys up quickly , I got this because I could no longer find the similar one from Bite Its ok and does moisturize my lips overnight but feels very oily which I dont like , Ive been using this for a while now and it is so nice to sleep in Leaves lips nice and soft for the morning , I purchased this as I was running out of my other one and decided to try it out the price for it its good however I found that when you put it on it drys up really quickly but it does leave the lips soft Ievenievery night for lips , Ok first let me start by saying this is amazing and such a game changer  Im in love with the unexpected creamy consistency of the product  the smell of coconut is very light  refreshing , I have been using this product to alleviate my dry chapped lips and I immediately felt the difference after one night I would highly recommend this It is so easy to incorporate into your nighttime routine smells amazing and in my experience actually works , I thought Id try this lip mask as Im a fan of other more expensive products but for 5 What Its absolutely gorgeous one of the best affordable lip masks Ive ever tried Definitely definitely recommend , bought the vinalla one to replace laneige sleeping mask it does the work but not upto the mark , I have been looking at many lip masksbalmsetc trying to find one that was good for me I was a little put off by the price of other lip masks and I wasnt sure how they would work so I hesitated in purchasing and boy am I glad I found this and based on the price point and the reviews I just had to try it So many say that it is a great dupe for the Laneige lip mask and while I cannot say from experience I think that for the price it is better I wouldnt know if this was 20 or 5 when it is on your lips I had these really cracked areas on my lips that literally just wouldnt go away I was using aquaphor every night and saw no major signs of improvement The second I started using this my lips felt like the moisture was finally back in them Within THREE DAYS the cracks were totally gone and I still applied it every night for about a week after trying to make sure they were fully repaired I LOOOVE this product and please buy if you dont know if the higher prices are worth it I felt the Laneige and this one is thinner but still effective and very pleasant to wear it doesnt feel like a heavy mask on your lips and has an amazing smell And it is super glossy and not super thick so you could even wear a thin layer as a daytime gloss And now that Ive thoroughly bored you Ill end this review here , I use this product before sleeping and it keeps my lips hydrated all night It applies smoothly and is not sticky I also love how the smell isnt too much I recommend and would buy it again , really pretty looking but not for dry cracked lips it feels more like alip oil , Feels nice when you apply it but evaporates verrrry quickly Definitely could not use as an overnight lip mask , Its okay Not very much vanilla smell Its moisturizing but not as much as Laneige and has a thinner runnier consistency I would spend the extra money and get Laneige or something comparable I do like the tube style packaging though , I really like this lip mask it really helped me with dry lips , love this lip sleeping mask It melts into my skin and I wake up with hydrated lips for the rest of the day  5 star , The vanilla smells so strongly of playdoh and has a slight taste to it Do not recommend , My lips were not moisturized while using this I had high hopes but ended up tossing it out , Does what its supposed to do I do recommend this product , me and my husband we love the product every night we put this balm before sleep ive had some issues on the night that make my lips breaks and bleed the smell is good and so smooth , i have extremely dry lips and this helps so much it is so hydrating and it lasts hours , The smell is amazing and i love the texture but the product doesnt work very well with my lips I see no difference when i use it , Love love love Use morning noon and night Smells amazing but subtle too Great in comparison to other lip sleeping mask , This didnt soak into my lip it say on top and when I woke up it would feel like a film is on top and its not a pleasant feeling but the smell was nice , I expected this to be slightly thicker than it actually was I also felt like it was more of a gloss than anything as did not actually absorb into my lips and rather sat on top The only redeeming quality was the scent , Love how soft my lips are when I use this in conjunction with a rose sugar lip scrub A little sad that the scent isnt a bit stronger  but still a good product so far Cant beat the price either , Its just amazing Smells good and moisturize well , It was a good product it smells good and really helps the lips , smells lovely and moisturizes well but not fantastic I put on lip balm and thrn this and it was 100 better , Makes your lips really soft night time routine Leaves your lips supple and kissable , I love the way this makes me lips feel I cant stop rubbing them togetherThe flavour is okay not super yummy but not terrible or overpowering , Such an incredible product I got strawberry and it smells and looks amazing on my lips It really has such a glossy and hydrating feel , The artificial vanilla smell is so overpowering I had to wipe it off right away and it still lingers quite intensely after The consistency is a bit thin doesnt feel like a lip mask that Im used to , After a couple of days my lips are so soft I dont have to wear a lip balm during the day anymore It works well and at a very small price  Would totally recommend it to everyone , Amazing  Save your money and dont spend it on laneige this is way better and a quarter of the price  , Great lip mask  I use it as lipgloss during the day as well  Very hydrating , Amazing product works wonderfully It really soothes and hydrates your lips , Dont let the consistency fool you When I first put it on I had flashbacks of those rollerballs with fruit on them from the 90s but try it overnight it really made my lips so soft and moisturized Great value , This is a nice moisturizing lip treatment It does not leave that awful white film that happens at the meeting of your lips a little goes a long way and I did not experience any tackiness , Really works Ive been using before bed and Im the morning and Ive really noticed a difference I cant say it taste like vanilla but its not bad I was skeptical at first after seeing some of the reviews but after a few weeks I can say my lips feel and look very hydrated , Was expecting a super hydrating lip mask but it just feels like a lip balm with a lip gloss texture It should be renamed as a hydrating lip gloss not a lip mask lol , Smells amazing Its a lip sleeping mask but more often than not ill apply it throughout the day Its a happy medium personally between thick and thin A little tacky but it doesnt bother me Absolutely love this Lip mask , Ok This is EVERYTHING  I absolutely love this product  It perfect at night before bed  I never wake up with dry or cracked lips anymore , feels a little tacky but just add on vaseline and ure golden , This is the first lip mask Ive bought so Im not exactly sure what its supposed to do but Ive just been using it as a gloss It dries fairly quickly and I find myself reapplying a good few times when I wear it for the day but it looks very pretty on its own or over a lip tint oil It has a very pleasant scent , the smell is really nice and the texture is too however for a product that is supposed to be a hydrating lip mask it is absolutely terrible and lasts for 10 minutes at most , Very moisturizing but it doesnt taste like vanilla , This just really feels like Vaseline in a tube It feels fine but it really doesnt do much of anything except moisturize for a little while , Bought it for my boyfriends severely cracked lips and this fixed it up right away Smells yummy too , Love Great lip balm for nighttime After brushing and flossing and using my white strips my lips feel dry and I cant sleep with dry lips The scent is light and good for me since I love vanilla it smells like real vanilla not the fake stuff The texture is medium thick and a little goes a long way I havent had any issues with the product getting in my mouth or whatever Ive read some bad reviews but I have had good a good experience My lips feel soft in the morning with no residue I bought this as a splurge sort of during the recent sale and I will buy it again since its only 7 , This product doesnt work not hydrating nice smell though , More like a sticky lipgloss than a lipmask very subtle flavor and scent nothing too Strawberrylike but shiny for a lil while A bit pricey for the small size considering my lipbalm is more like a lipmask for cheaper The tubeend is not very lipfriendly its flat and a bit scratchy so one has to carefully dab the product onto lipsRecommend only as sticky gloss but not mask , My lips were hydrated and kissable this morning as I tried it for the first night last night I know it doesnt have the best reviews but I guess my experience with it was different it actually had the pleasant vanilla smell I might have ruined the effect by applying another product I reviewed which was the dragon fruit lip balmscrub , This is no Laneige sleeping mask but its pleasant It dries up after a few hours and has a slight chemical taste All in all decent for the price point but Ill probably shell out more money for my beloved Laneige lip mask , This did nothing at all I got it on a whim because it was on sale on the counter at checkout It smells like playdoh its goopy and slimy and in the morning my lips are just as dry as they were when I went to sleep Im going to finish the tube because I dont like to waste things but from now on Ill stick with my Laneige , Lips feel very soft next day  Small amount works fine , Hate this It was gross and grosser  This felt like battery acid on my skin Returned Never looked back  Got a different lip mask instead , this stuff hydrates my lips so well the only con is that the vanilla one smells like playdoh lol , I have struggled with chapped lips I cant breathe through my nose so j am a mouth breather my lips would often feel like sandpaper and be peeling This WONDERFUL product finally makes my lips look normal and feel healthy its only been a few days and I am hooked I use it all day long , lowkey a dupe for most laniege lip products plus its only 5 , I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews but went ahead and gave it a try Surprisingly its quite effective and healed my chapped lips overnight Will buy again , Keeps my lips hydrated literally all night they stay very plump and hydrated throughout the next day Has worked better than any lip balm I have used im in love If you care about the tastesmell then I would suggest trying the strawberry but the vanilla isnt bad , Smells super good but does nothing to help moisturize lips Super sticky and runny , I use this all the time and it is amazing The vanilla isnt too overpowering but its just enough to make the mask enjoyable , Its alright Nothing special it smells like vanilla which is nice I guess but for me personally it dries out super quickly Shouldve gotten a Vaseline lip balm from the dollar store It feels nice when you put it on tho , I am not a fan of the scent Smells like a barbie doll plastic vanilla scentThe hydration is as good as Vaseline I suppose Not worth the price There are better options at the drugstore , Smells good and hydrate while its still wet on my lips but doesnt do much on the long run , Just meh I find Vaseline does the same thing It does leave your lips very soft after a couple nigh"
Mattifying Blotting Papers,"I used the Sephora Blot It blotting papers for many years This new product is literally a package of wax paper that not only takes off makeup in its application you need 23 sheets to even make a difference in oil reduction Very dissapointed , Fait ce quun papier ratifiant devrait faire mais est remplie dhuile trs vite , Weird texture didnt absorb oil and just ended up smearing my makeup Better products out there , Love this product Reasonably priced for 100 sheets of paper Great for oiley skin and perfect size to keep in your pocket and use anywhere on the go , Havent tried with makeup but surprised how many you get for the price , I have been using Sephora face blotters for ages and they are just the bestI have them in my hand bag and another pack in my car at all timesSo convenient and handy and they work beautifully , Wow I am shocked how absolutely tiny these blotting papers are I have used the Sephora brand blotting papers for years  they were great So I dont know what happened to the originals , Just as expected I dont wear face makeup so Im not sure if it transfers but my face can get pretty oily throughout the day and this does the job Dont see the point in spending more than this on some paper , Such a great bang for your buck My face is super oily and I use about two papers to remove oil and it stays that way the whole day I love it Im going to buy more , First time trying blotting papers so I cant compare to others but I like it Mattifies my tzone and I go over with powder afterwards so I dont look like a grease ball , You should be ashamed to sell these tiny squares that are half the size of the orig and made from horrible film that slides oil over your face instead of absorbing it Total trash Please go back to the ones you used to have that were PAPER and actually WORKED , These dont absorb oil and dont mattify Not worth any price , Ivd tried many blotting papers and this is definitely the worst , I have used many brands of blotting papers for thirty years with no issues but these actually lifted my foundation right back off my skin In all areas including cheeks not just nose I have combo skin my cheeks are dry For 4 you have nothing to lose by trying yourself Just saying I was surprisingly disappointed Dont know what Ill use them for now Premakeup , Theyre blotting paper sheets They work as intended and blot oil well Packaging is nicely minimalist and simple"
Melting Cleansing Balm Cleanse + Balance,"This item does not work well at all  Sad I wanted to like it and appreciate the container being so light which makes it more travel friendly , Ive repurchased this 5 times It breaks down my makeup beautifully and is perfect for the price , Affordable priced And washes off a lot better than the oat cleansing balm while also being non irritating  the oat cleansing balm from the inkey leaves a film and gets in the way of serums So this is a recommend from me , This wasnt my favorite cleansing balm It does not melt and turn into a creamy balmoil like others It says thick and lotiony and didnt do a good job at breaking my makeup down Also left a film on my skin Pass on this one , I absolutely love this product Its a game changer when it comes to taking off your make up easy and not leaving your face feeling greasy or sticky afterwards This definitely will be one of my new go tos in my night routine Highly recommend , I tried this product out for like 3 months Never really removed my makeup especially my eye makeup it just smeared it around my face always had to use another product to have it completely remove all my makeup also when i was done using the product it left a weird feeling on my skin like it was still built up on my skin even after double cleansing and kinda felt like plastic I would not recommend this product to anyone if you want a cheap cleansing balm that works really well get the Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original instead , Very thick and does not break down makeup that well Thought I was going to love it because I usually love Sephora collection but this one just was a miss , UGH I bought this because it had some very good reviews here but I hate it The smell is unpleasant but much worse is that it does not soften in your hands from body heat and it does NOT emulsify well at all Really the most useless cleansing balm ever The price should have been a clue Absolute garbage , Its okay for how affordable it is but I dont like its texture its kind of goopy and sticky and I feel like it doesnt really melt and emulsify on your skin It seems to do a fine job getting make up of but I really dislike the texture compared to other cleansing balms It at lease dissolves and washes away very nicely with water Ill use it up but wont be repurchasing , i really like it before using it I was doing a single wash but the double wash has made a difference i dont have a ton of experience with cleansing balms and perhaps I like this one because its the first one I tried it feels very nice on the skin and has a subtle scent that is nice as well I wont give it 5 stars cause Im not raving over it but I still think its a great option and Im happy with the price and quality overall , I like this product I feel it does a good job but of course you have to double cleanse It is not the best at removing mascara but many cleansing oils or balms still leave you a little or residue so you need to go with a second cleanser Overall good price and good amount of products I wouldnt buy it again because there are many options to try out and it was not amazing , Generally a really good product Helps to effectively remove makeup Would not recommend for oily skin But overall decent Needed to apply more than indicated on the package , It does take off your makeup but I cant stand the smell Every time I use it I feel like I have to hold my breath or just gag Smells like putty I wont repurchase because of the smell The texture is also a bit thick and waxy , The best cleansing balm ever doesnt sting eyes and is super hydrating and not stripping 100 recommend  , Ever since I got this this is almost the only thing I use to take off my makeup Formula is quite nice and convenient packaging Really comparable to the more high end cleansing balms Its most likely discontinued now which is shocking and sad , i love this product i use it everyday and surprisingly it helped me with my acne its also really easy to use , This doesnt remove regular mascara as seamlessly as other cleansing balms and oils Ive tried Crumbly bits stay on your eyes and it takes a lot of rubbing which can cause lash fallout or skin irritation It washes off okay but you definitely need to double cleanse to feel clean I think if you can spare a few extra dollars the physicians formula cleansing balm is much much better This is also personal preference but I really wish this wasnt in a tub  a squeeze tube is so much more hygienic and easy to portion control , Ive been looking for a cleansing balm for a while now and I purchased this due to it being a good price for the amount of product that you get When I received this product I was pretty excited about using because I always hear good things about cleansing balms in general I was wearing a full face of make up and waterproof mascara at the time I really wanted to see how well this product worked Overall it wasnt bad and Im sure there are plenty of cleansing balms out there that are way better My personal opinion on this was that this cleansing balm was pretty decent It does have that film everyone was talking about but it honestly didnt bother me much because I double cleanse Definitely worth looking into it , The cleansing balm works well however the parfum in it is offputting  I have not decided if I will repurchase , I tried this because I liked their previous cleansing oil and cleansing oil in balm both which are no longer for saleI didnt really like the texture when applying but I didnt think much of it because its meant to be removedAfter washing with warm water it still felt filmy even though it says specifically it wont but I still didnt think much of it because I was using it in a double cleanse as I will wash again with a waterbased cleanserAfter finishing the double cleanse it did not feel clean at all I had to double cleanse again after using the waterbased cleanser again before my face felt close to normal So 5x cleansing which is ridiculous This is the only product Ive tried from this store that I wanted to return but of course now I cant because of the shortened return window I did try adding jojoba oil when applying this and it seems to wash away much easier now only double cleansing once So at least not a total waste of money I guess , I use this balm at the end of the day to mostly remove SPF and some makeup I have to admit I dont wear much makeup though so its not like I need to remove mascara everyday using this It works well and I find my skin is clean afterwards When I wear mascara I do use an eye makeup remover first as it doesnt melt away mascara the way it does foundation or SPF I really like it and would repurchase Doesnt burn or sting my sensitive skin and also doesnt make it dry so I love it , Doesnt take any of my waterproof mascara off even after rubbing , This cleansing balm isnt great the ELF one is way better , It had all the makings of being a good product and then they had to add fragrance Its not good if you any skin sensitivity , Vaseline is better than this Really disappointed in this product which will now just sit in my bathroom to rot , Good for sensitive skin It doesnt take off all the makeup but most of it I use it with a cotton pad For starting the day is perfect as a cleanse It leaves a very smooth skin , I was personally not the biggest fan my eyes are highly sensitive to this product It definitely gets rid of eye makeup well but it leaves a foggy cast on the eyes I also would find bits of my mascara clumping to my inner corners after using it It still works just not for me , I enjoy using this to clean off makeup Leaves a bit of an oily layer when washing off with just water I dont mind it since Im trying not to dry out my face when washing but can be removed with another cleanser I quite like the smell and enjoy using it A tub of this really goes a long way , Hate the consistency felt like grease tbh Will return Weird smell too , this product takes off my makeup very well 1010 would buy again , My absolute favourite cleansing balm to take off my makeup and SPF at the end of the day This is my first step before I go in with a second cleanser Repurchased multiple times and always have another one as a back up just incase Doesnt make skin feel oily or like theres a residue left behind and removes all my makeup Definitely recommend , Just okay Not solid like Clinique take the day off Reminds me more of another brands cleansing balm i think maybe farmacys Someone else said it reminded them of Vaseline and i would agree Not able to cut through mascara like Clinique can but gets the job done for the most part , Does it remove makeup Yes Very well in fact I would say the melting part is not necessarily true The best way to describe the consistency is comparing it to Vaseline Its very thick and it doesnt melt down I use water to remove it all and the makeup slides right off , It does what its supposed to do I wear a little makeup brow product and mascara and sunscreen and Ive never had any issue with it For the price I think its great I would prefer if the smell would be more subtle but its fine since its a rinse off product , Okay so here is the rundown on this product If youre looking for a luxurious cleansing balm that breaks down makeup really well and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean after one cleanse this isnt the product for you HOWEVER for the price along with the amount of product you get it is a decent product I use it to remove my makeup after a night out and always follow with a second cleanse My skin feels very clean and makeup free after Does it have a nice smell and feel luxurious on my face No But its honestly a great bang for your buck and Ill probably buy it again because it hasnt broken me out Overall rating 45 , Let me start this review by saying I dont wear makeup so i cant attest to its makeup removing ability i use this as the first cleanse in my double cleanse to remove sunscreen but its just ok it has a very strong scent that i dont like and i dont even mind fragrance in products and doesnt really melt as the name would suggest It does leave a weird film on your face after rinsing Makes your eyes cloudy after rubbing it on your face Even for the price I think youd be better off just buying a more expensive one thats better It manages to get my sunscreen off decently well but id imagine you it would be tough to get makeup off with it Overall id say find another cleansing balmoil if you are looking for one , Great price and smells nice but it still leaves traces of my makeup behind The texture is too thick for ease of gliding across my face Would not repurchase Will stick to my Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm by Clinique , The first time I bought it I would have given it 5 starsDig in apply to dry face  rinse off It was amazing at removing all my makeup without a messI ordered it again after having to wait for it to come back in stock I believe the product has been watered down as it is now quite sloppy to applyuse The entire consistency is just runnier than the last one was  A lot runnierIm not buying it again , Great value gets job done but I find Im waiting to finish it as I dont like the texture and prefer my Clinique take the day off balm , A good price but takes a while to remove waterproof eye make up And I dont feel like it takes foundation off completely like Farmacy Green Clean I like the Green Clean because I like to double cleanse even without makeup I dont want my cleanser to have to work extra to take off make up as well Also notice that Green Clean makes my skin feel smooth and truly clean better then this does I recommend as a budget option but its not a dupe by any means , As far as I can tell this is every bit as good as Clinique Take the Day Off Farmacy Green Clean and Drunk Elephant Slaai Ive tried them all And if you tried the Sephora oilbalm and hated it this is not the same Really gets makeup and SPF fully loose and doesnt leave a greasy film after a second cleanse If youre looking to save money on anything in your routine this is perfect If youre not looking to save money this is still perfect , takes everything off is great for sensitive skin and doesnt leave a residue once you rinse it off the amount of product you get for the price is awesome , Best thing for makeup Takes mine off quickly smells great not too strong and leaves my skin feeling awesome , If you like the Clinique take the day off balm then you will love this This is a less expensive option that does the same job You will always have to double cleanse when using a balm this is the first step to melt off all your makeup before using your face wash This helps get your skin clean and helps you avoid using makeup removing wipes , Excellent balm makeup remover for the price point but you MUST doublecleanse to get rid of oily film Wont strip your skin and can handle the most stubborn waterproof mascaras I purchased this during the spring sale and will repurchase , A great makeup removing balm for step 1 in a double cleanse I have dry very sensitive skin and this is my goto balm because it doesnt contain fragrance Ive tried other cleansing oils and balms and usually end up with irritation with regular use because of all the fragrance in them The texture on this one is pretty thick so takes a few more seconds to work it into your skin than the Farmacy version But Im so happy that it doesnt strip my skin or irritate my eyes HIGHLY recommend for people with sensitive skin that struggle to find products that dont cause redness and reactions , So so good Takes EVERYTHING off in seconds Doesnt burn or irritate my eyes Doesnt leave a weird film or any residue Love how large the container is too , Amazing Wayyy better than even the farmacy cleansing balm I stocked up and bought three I was so impressed by this , good for dry skin and does melt away makeup but not meant as a full cleanser if you use this to remove your makeup make sure you use a second cleanser to remove any excess impurities worth the price  would recommend , Honestly the best stuff and doesnt dry out your face You dont even need much so its worth it for the price , Total love Cant even believe I was lucky enough to get it on sale too , It is a great cleansing balm even though it takes a little bit more time to take off your mascara Actually it is a cleansing balm that doesnt let your face get oily and that was something I was looking for a cleansing balm , Ive tried a few Sephora products recently and I love them all this cleanser is creamy any and leaves my face so refreshed followed by the the Sephora moisturizers , I genuinely cant believe how well this takes my makeup off I tend to find even after I remove all my makeup Ill still wake up with mascara under my eyes but with this theres nothing it removes 100 of the makeup I remove most of my makeup with micellar water first then use this to make sure its all off and it leaves my skin feeling so soft If your looking for a good affordable makeup removercleanser this is it , Removes makeup well and I have found that since using this regularly this patch of blackheads I get has disappeared I removed 1 star only because it doesnt feel as luxurious as other cleansing balms Ive used The price point is fabulous for what you get , Its very ok I think the people who love this havent tried Korean cleansing balms This balm is sticky and doesnt melt into an oil It does an ok job at cleaning I dont like the scent or the texture I hope I can get a refund I will say its a lot of product for not a lot of money , melts all my makeup off love it It perfect for taking off a full face of makeup , Clumped up for me didnt remove my makeup wouldnt repurchase , For me works as well as Clinique balm No break outs Doesnt leave residue feels gentle but removes eye makeup well Will repurchase 100 , Not as hydratingluxurious feeling as the Farmacy one but works VERY well for its price It was able to remove my extremely waterproof mascara heroine make kiss me mascara and I am satisfied with that Theres no fragrance but a slight waxycandle smell which Im not a fan of but I cant really complain much given its price I will buying this from now on instead of the farmacy Very good deal whenever SC is 30 off too  , As someone who wears SPF and a full face of make up daily having a good make up removing balm is very important to me in my skin care routine Ive been using the Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing balm for 4 years and have been afraid to stray away yet I was always hoping for a cheaper alternative At Sephora one of the ladies recommended this to me and said it was very close to the Farmacy one I took the plunge and am so glad I tried itThe formula is slightly thicker than the Farmacy one but it still spreads easily on the face once you rub it in It rinses clean with just water and does not leave any residue I always do a double cleanse regardless but my face would feel fine even if I did skip it It removed all of my SPF foundation eyeliner and eyebrows just as effectively as the Farmacy oneI have been using it for two weeks and havent broken out either which is a great sign I will buying this one in the future instead of the Farmacy one and my wallet will be so much happier , best cleansing balm ive used doesnt leave your skin feeling dry afterwards if anything a little more hydrated , Bought this as a cheaper substitute for Farmacy Green Clean but wouldnt repurchase The cleansing power of it works well but the consistency is much different than green clean Feels more like a thick gel than balm and takes a while warm up in your fingers before working into the skin which makes it feel like Im pulling my skin by using this Not worth returning As long as I have the budget for Farmacy Ill stick with that , Its a good cleansing balm I normally buy the Clinique cleansing balm but decided for the price difference this was worth giving a try Ive tried some cleansing balms that felt like they left a film on my face and I didnt get that with this one I deducted a star because it does irritate my eyes slightly not enough to not use it but something I dont experience with the Clinique , Easily removes all my makeup even mascara and brow products that I find hard to remove with other things This is a great value too , I normally use the Farmacy Green Clean cleansing balm as my first cleanse and thought Id try this since it is less than half the price It broke me out in a rash on the first use which is very disappointing Will be returning While it melts and spreads nicely it does not clean as well as other cleansing balms Ive used in the past If youre looking for a affordable cleansing balm Id try the Inkey List Oat Cleaning Balm instead The oat cleansing balm worked well with my dry and sensitive skin , Really is the best value cleansing balm I can find anywhere , I used to use the drunk elephant equivalent as well as the one by farmacy however for the price this one is far superior Takes my makeup off beautifully And I always double cleanse so I never have a residue left , Under hyped item I genuinely love this cleansing balm to double cleanse Not to mention it really gets all my makeup off Especially my waterproof makeup very impressive Make sure you warm the product up in your hands so that the heat form your hands melts it down before washing your face My face feels so fresh and clean just after using it Its definitely not abrasive on the skin for me at least Seeing a few reviews complaining about the item I highly suggest you go to your local Sephora and ask for a sample before buying it , Love this cleansing balm you just massage it in I let it sit for a minute like when brushing my teeth or washing my hands or something and then wipe it off with a reusable cotton pad then follow up with my normal skincare if you have thick full coverage this will help melt it away if you have waterproof makeup leave it for a few more minutes and then normal skin care It doesnt smell like anything it doesnt break you out it is a huge tub for a great price , Glorified vaseline it doesnt melt in your hands it has the same texture as vaseline doesnt really melt your face makeup foundation make up either but is wonderful for strictly eye makeup , got this right when the sale started and immediately returning i have acne prone skin that i have gotten under control but as soon as i used this my forehead broke me out  it also stings my eyes do not recommend  this at all , I bought this because of the price but it was so disappointing I guess you get what you pay for I use waterproof eyelinermascara and this doesnt not remove it I have to rub it hard and I hate doing that to sensitive areas on my face I do not recommend , It definitely gets the job done however I found the texture to be too thick Its very hard to wash off , This cleansing balm is okay its not the best out there but its not bad either I have to apply the product about 3 times for it to completely remove my make up The smell of the product is okay it doesnt really bother me and it did not burn my eyes or anything i dont think i would purchase this product again , Takes all your makeup off but can be hard to take off your face so it and your makeup will end up on your towel if you dont rinse extensively , Do not buy Ugh Im so disappointed The reviews are so misleading The balm stays on your face even after cleansing twice As I write this review I still have balm stuck in my eyes after rinsing them multiple times Not worth it save your money and buy something else , leaves slight residue after rinsing off and stings eyes It removes makeup and gets the job done but it takes a bit longer than other cleansing balms Ive tried Not sure if I received an old one but the smell seemed slightly off almost like a faint cucumber smell borderline fishy Wont be repurchasing , This is an okay cleansing balm I would say it is a little on the greasy side but overall it does its job , Look this is far from the best cleansing balm Ive tried It works but it does not work as well as some of the other popular ones out there But in terms of bang for buck you cant go wrong This is a LARGE tub for a really good price It doesnt dry out my skin or irritate it I use it as a first step at night in my cleansing routine and use a regular cleanser after so I never use it on its own or experience residue So its fine Will I repurchase this I dont know I fee like the tub I have will last for a year and I have quite a few samples and 100 point perks of different better balms so my instinct is to say no but I will use the entire thing up no problem I think its a decent choice for people who are price conscious , Theyre better products than this Cant complain the oz and price is really good but it isnt as effective It doesnt emulsify well Does leave a petroleum film as if you are using Vaseline Does not take off waterproof mascara and need to work in the product more to break down the makeup , Sephora came hard  this is such a GREAT deal a little goes a long way so the you definitely get more for your money  i love that  it does not sting or take long to melt the makeup very settle smell and its actually really calming and soothing  so happy with the results definitely a repurchase , Not only is it affordable with decent amount of product its effective in gently removing makeup with no eye irritation You just need to be patient in removing waterproof makeup but itll get the job done nevertheless and I would still highly recommend , I really like this It didnt make my face feel tight after using I have oilycombo skin I love the feel of it I would agree with others that you may need to use more than you think but overall I would repurchase it again  , This stuff melts your makeup right off price is great too Only complaint is that I feel like it leaves my skin feeling dry after using But it does its job , My skin is far less dry when using this instead of the Deep Cleaning oil I follow up with a non foaming cleanser abs its been amazing I love the texture and it works very well to remove makeup , Ive used this for about a week now and love it You dont have to use a lot to remove your makeup If you put some on your eyelashes and let sit while doing the rest of your face the mascara comes right off The price is a big plus Ive had no reaction to it , Pretty good cleaning balm My only complaint would be  is that Im using more product than I would like to be using in order to do a good job Well priced and does the job , Works just as well as Farmacy Melts all types of makeup including mascara , Having tried the farmacy balm I would say it is not the same it is very much a gel texture and not an oil but it is a great makeup remover Considering the price this is an excellent product and surpassed my expectations , As per other reviewers its not good Doesnt remove my waterproof mascara unlike other balms , Love this product It melts all of my waterproof foundation away I have super sensitive skin and it doesnt react to it at all , Best makeup removing balm at this price More balmy than oily which makes for great emulsion Light pleasant smell Easy to use highly recommend no residue try it Packaging could be cuter but it is sleek and totally doable  , This is hands down the best make up remover I have ever used I have very sensitive eyes and this is so gentle I even accidently got some in my eye and it didnt even burn It takes a very small amount to wipe away 24 hour eyeliner so that jar will last a long time , Il retire bien le maquillage sans asscher ou irriter la peau  Cest parfait pour ceux qui ont les yeux sensibles En plus il nest vraiment pas cher compar aux autres marques semblables On a pas besoin den appliquer une grosse quantit pour russir  enlever toute trace de maquillage Clairement que je recommande ce produit  je vais certainement le racheter , This cleanser is honestly your average cleansing balm in terms of removing makeup I noticed it doesnt do amazingly in taking off waterproof makeupI will say after using it my skin feels decently hydrated and not at all stripped of moisture so thats a plusThe texture is a different story however It smells buttery to begin but once massaged into the skin it feels waxy and a little oily I would recommend this to people with skin on the drier side but honestly better cleansers exist out there , My new favorite cleansing balmand Ive tried them all , Does not remove waterproof eye makeup I also find it overly emollient It felt almost like washing with Vaseline I just didnt enjoy the texture Other cleansing balms start from a more solid form Not my favorite but would be good for light makeup wearers with dry skin , My eyes usually get very irritated and burn when removing makeup this did not do that at all Left a little residue but that came off with cleanser , I like the color consistency smell and overall performance of this cleanser on my facial skin but not on my eyes , Idk if I just got a bad batch or what but this stuff did not work for me There was significant amounts of base makeup mascara and liquid liner left behind even after cleansing twice I was hoping this would be a dupe for higher priced makeup cleansing balms but looks like Ill be going back to more tried and true products , For the price I paid its not bad  Leaves my skin clean and soft , Works ok to dissolve makeup Forget removing waterproof mascara with this my mascara stayed on for two days Its a decent size and not expensive but wouldnt recommend for anyone that uses waterproof makeup , Omg just the best its the only thing that I will use for taking my makeup off from low on , takes makeup off really well including waterproof eye makeup but definitely needs to be washed off afterwards because it leaves residue , Not great at melting mascara or removing heavy makeup I usually need to go in a second time will not be repurchasing would only recommend for people who keep it light with just sunscreen or maybe a little powder otherwise not worth it , Part of my double cleansing routine now Gets rid of face and eye makeup with just a few easy rubs Much easier and less harsh on my skin than other makeup removing methods , Affordable Great for sensitive skin Will continue to purchase this product , I was relatively surprised to how well it works just as good as clinique cleansing balm but for a lot mote cheaper I feel like it slides better when you wet your face first , Works as well as the Clinique balm Removed all makeup and only mildly did that eye fog thing that other balms do , Great at removing makeup and double cleansing Doesnt make my skin congested like other cleansing oils Leaves my skin soft but not greasy feeling , I love it so much this was only 10 and it lasts me so long I honestly didnt have high expectations for this but it honestly amazed me It took the makeup off so easily I think it took me like 1 minute to full get my face clean Definitely recommend , This left a thick waxy residue on my skin and did not fully remove my makeup There was still makeup on my towel after double cleansing with this and another cleanser I was hoping it would be a dupe for the Farmacy Green Clean product but it was a HUGE disappointment It also made me break out , Ive tried so many cleansing balms Elemis Drunk Elephant Clinique Pharmacy and more I LOVED the Green Clean it was my favorite but I picked this gem up to give it a try and Im so glad I did This balm is amazing Like all balms it does make your eyes a bit cloudy but this one has less of that and the fog is gone in less than a minute It removes my waterproof eye makeup better than any other Once I finish my Green Clean I will be picking this one up again Highly recommend , So great for my dry skin I love the thick consistency it spreads easily over my skin easily breaking down sunscreen After rinsing off my skin feels moisturized , Great dupe for the Clinique cleansing balm takes all my makeup off and perfect for double cleansing , Hated this product S"
Metal Facial Razor,"I was tired of buying the cheap ones that you have to throw away then I found this product Its a quick and a easy way to remove any hairs thats on my face I especially love it to shape my eyebrows , I does makes sense that sephors razor quality is like 10 times better than your drugstore razor ngl I used this and I am never purchasing those again , I absolutely love this product Its very sharp and can get ur desired ur brow shape Be aware of it because its very sharp and u dont need much effort to shape ur eyebrows , When I first bought this it was great The blazes were sharp and effective However the 3 times I bought refills the blade quality got worse and worse Some of them fit poorly and broke upon insertionremoval None of them were as sharp as the initial blades that came with the handle This is very irritating to the skin and can cause breakoutsredness when dermoplaning Do yourself a favor and buy a scalpel handle and some medical grade blades instead Its what aestheticians use and it is much cheaper You can find a handle for like 5 bucks and it fits standard scalpel blade sizes Size 10 is good for dermoplaning , Ive been doing my own microdermabrasion for a while now using disposable facial razors   I finally stepped up  bought this and its a game changer    This is so well balanced and well made  its like a surgical tool   And being able to get refills for it is awesome   My serums are working like magic and my skin has its glow back   Thank you Sephora , I love the metal body of this facial razor  I had never used a facial razor before but this little buddy was easy to handle and easy to swap out the blade  I worried I was going to accidentally cut myself but I didnt have any troubles using it  Will buy the refills , I like the handle and weight of the razor The blades themselves seem to do a good job My main issue is taking them in and out They get stuck and if your not careful youll slice open your fingers , Ive been using this since December and I will never go back to waxing After using this my face is soft and it helps my skin absorb products better Waxing seems so violent now Glad I found this , Great alternative to disposables and honestly the most affordable metal razor I could find The blade isnt as hard to remove as others make it seem at least I had no real trouble with it But I  think some blades might have slight defects that make them finicky to insert at times Its a sharp blade but not sharper than the disposable one I was using before If youre totally new to this look up how to use it properly first FYI I use this on completely dry skin , Awesome razor It took a long time for me to decide whether to use razors on my face or not but the result is amazing My skin has never felt so smooth , Well made and works like it should  I have used cheaper ones and they just dont work the same , The best facial razor Ive ever used Literally took out all the peach fuzz and facial hair , Used this razor only once with the original blade The product is defective and a complete waste of your money especially if youre like me and didnt find out until after the 60day window when trying to replace the blade Used everything from tweezers to pliers to try to get it out Customer service will refuse to rectify this issue  be extremely unreasonable and brash Even though the item is practically brand new I even purchased the replacement blades along with it more money down the drain The razor is entirely useless now Extremely disappointed with Sephora with the amount of money I frequently spend with this company and lack of solutions This item is garbage and needs to be taken off the site until the product design is corrected Wish I could give it zero stars , I had used the Schick Hydro Silk TouchUp razors before and they would nick my face and was barely able to get much hair at all with it which left me with a pretty sour view of athome facial razors  However I bought this little beauty because I was short on time before an event and it DELIVERED  My skin felt so super smooth afterward the amount peach fuzz that came off was unreal and my makeup went on easily  I did nick my face a slight bit but not too bad so hopefully that will come with practice but overall so good , The handle has some weight to it which makes it sturdy and durable , works well i actually cut my finger getting it out of the package so be careful  , Over priced razor A 2 Kai razor is much easier to use , Does exactly what its supposed to do Feels very weighty and good quality I think its worth the extra money , This just what I needed for cleaning up my eyebrows This is gentle but gets the hairs off It comes with a really nice case too and a few blades , Great razor but the blade was stuck so I couldnt use the replacement blades I even tried using pliers to get it out but it wouldnt budge I just ended up scratching the blade from trying so hard to pull it out , I loved the razor so much but when it was time to replace the razor it was stuck I read all the advice on removing them but I guess mine was defective , So good no other words needed If you like this style of product this is very long lasting and eco friendly , Is good but really hard to change the blade I cut my fingers trying to do it , It takes a bit getting into a routine and understanding how to use the razors but these are lovely once you get the process , Works perfect Ive used cheaper ones and they hurt the face Made sure I had my skin care done and moisturizer on to avoid any burningMy skin already looks better , This is by far the best razor I have purchased for my fine baby hairs I usually pair it with either YTPP or Josie Marin oil for a super soft experience , This razor is such high quality Ive searched everywhere for a razor like this This razor gets rid of all your peach fuzz and then some My face is incredibly smooth and glowy after using this I love that you can buy replacements as , Love this product Ive been using for over a year now its a must in my skin care routine , Loved this its a great purchase but beware it is very sharp , I love this Metal Facial Razor I use it about one to two times a month I keep up with my peel pads and retinol serums to ensure my skin feels smooth and radiant , Super sharpe dont be careful Metal handle makes it easy to hold on to Is slightly heavy Can change blades pretty easily , I have a much more expensive dermaplaner that I paid 80 for and the refills cost 28 for 7 blades Im not going to use it anymore because this is better Not only is it less expensive it allows more precise control each blade can be used a few times and it removes hair in a single pass unlike my other tool which often requires a few passes over cheekbone hallows or jawline Cant say enough good things I just hope they never stop selling the refills Im going to stock up just in case , Loved this razor until it was time to change the blade There are no instructions but after reading the qa I realized that mine came defective but aside from that it was great Great quality no cutting and very smooth , Wow I have been on the fence to do this for a long time and Im so happy I bit the bullet and purchased this After I watched a few how to videos I gave it a try and it turned out really well I have been self conscious for awhile about how much peach fuzz was all over my face  Id read about other benefits to using one of these  exfoliation and allows serums to sink in more effectively I picked this one because it had good reviews was more environmentally friendly than disposable options and it looked like a good oneFor the price I think its a great value it comes with refills and It has a good package to store the tool in 100 reccomend , I love this It removes peach fuzz and dead skin so easily and makes me look younger and more puttogether somehow Its amazing what a huge difference it makes when my skin has a neater appearance , I bought this never having dermaplaned before There were many ways this could have ended badly if I didnt have a quality razor This one did a great job Glass over skin without nicks or cuts I was able to use it three times before I switched it out for a new blade Cleaning the blade and switching them out is easy but you should still be careful when using something so sharp The razor has a good wait in the handle making it not feel flimsy Cuts great even when you have a very short weeks worth of growth after first shave Love that you can buy refill razors Definitely worth it , I love this razor The quality is remarkable 5stars all the way , Im very impressed with this razor Its not scratchy and it has good weight to it It comes with extra blades and a storage case Definitely worth it , Such a good quality razor The handle is a great length and good weight It feels like a durable product overall and comes with a case cover for the blade and extra replacement blades , This razor is so nice Worth the money I compared it with the tweezerman which I also purchased from Sephora The tweezerman is just like the razors at the beauty store for a dollar This is SO much better than both of those Very soft and smooth and not scratchy on the skin at all and the blades are very easy to replace It comes with extra blades too It is very well made and intuitive I just looked around and pressed on a little plastic piece and the blade slid right up And easily goes back down and locks into place I love the feel of the metal handle too All in all five stars , the best facial razor Ive tried so far not scratchy at all very happy with my purchase , Too bad I got a defected razor otherwise Id love this It works well but I cant replace the blades I even followed directions and ended up breaking my nail trying to take out the razor I cant even exchange it because of the 60 day return policy Never buying this one again Thanks Sephora , Overall use is pretty great and doesnt scratch my skin compared to other cheap plastic facial razor This is the first time I have had a metal facial razor and thats sustainably great Otherwise it is counterintuitive on how it comes in a plastic case I know its important to showcase the product but we could do that by keeping one in a display case An alternative would be to sell this in a clothed pouch Additionally I love how there are three additional blade refills that come with this and a separate purchase for refills I know some reviews have said that its a bit difficult to remove the blade which initially I agreed but its not impossible to remove it When I first tried I used my pair of beauty scissors or you could also use some tweezers to push the blade out with that little plastic tab make that metal too Its actually okay that the blade doesnt come out too easily because who knows if it could come out while youre dermaplaning your face yikes , Been using this facial razor for a year now and with great results Helps eliminate peach fuzz and dead skin cells Also helps penetrate your skincare products more effectively Highly recommend , The blades dont stay in when you change them but the tool its self worked well Its also hard to replace without touching the blade itself , Best one Ive used yet and I have tried several brands Highly recommend Worth every dollar Be careful super sharp , It removes all unwanted hair in one swipe   It clean up my eyebrows perfectly You have to be careful its very  sharp but it will gets the job done This product is a must have  with your daily routine , Best facial razor Ive used thus far I like the fact that you can replace the blades more eco friendly Its heavier than the plastic ones but I actually like that I find it actually helps when using it , This tool gives you a glow you didnt even know you had Yes its a bit weird the first time but its so satisfying to watch the peach fuzz fall away I love that it also exfoliates away dead skin Watch howto videos and be very very gentle Oh and I dont recommend using it on the brow bone I got an ingrown hair that was hard to get rid of Doesnt seem to happen on the rest of the face , the razor itself is great i bought one but they actually sent me two Thanks sephora but ive noticed finger prints on the substitute razor blades which seemed oily and theyre literally on every blade so I would recommend disinfecting your razor before the first use I will be a repeated buyer because these are of top quality , I bought this because I have been struggling with acne Everything I have tried in my skincare routine wasnt working I started using this and I had SO MUCH dead skin I was shaving off My skin feels smooth and is starting to look better The razor is sharp but it is very easy to use This is the best purchase I have ever made , I love it I purchased this facial razor for the first time during the Sephora sale and after using it for the first time and Id repurchase again full price Id been using the disposable type facial razors for many years this razor is far superior theres no comparison It left my skin super soft and smooth with no irritation I also love that it comes in its own little storage case , i love this freaking razor so much leaves my skin feeling smooth and no irritation there is a bit of a learning curve if youre not used to using facial razors like this make sure to keep your skin moist and pull it taut so you dont scratch yourself only downside is that the razor refills dont seem to be in stock very often , i started shaving my face a few months ago and i love it listen to the reviews saying this is VERY sharp i nicked myself a few times because i was using too much pressure once you get the hang of it it glides beautifully and leaves the skin so smooth , This is the best facial razor Ive ever used hands down I was using high quality plastic razors but this one is so much better It removes hairexfoliates like a dream 1010 recommend , I was tired of buying plastic razors on Amazon to have them go dull after 2 uses The plastic waste was also pretty annoying so I gave this one a chance The handle is substantial and the razor is really sharp and is still great after a few uses I love that is more sustainable than the alternatives and the refill pack is only 10 for 3 , This is great Its nicely weighted easy to grip Peach fuzz be gone Well worth it Bonus its more sustainable than the disposable plastic ones , This razor is just what I was hoping for It works great and gets all that nasty peach fuzz My face is smooth for makeup application This unit also comes with refills I just feel it is more sanitary easier to clean and will last longer than the plastic kind One work of caution however if you shave your brows this is a large sharp blade and you will need to be extra careful or use a plastic shaver , Exactly what I needed to help clean up my eyebrows Love that its metal so theres bit more weight to it , Excellent product The handle has a really nice weight in the hand and makes it easy to control t is much easier to use than the disposable plastic kind It doesnt remove the same amount of skin as a professional dermaplaning does but I dont think thats a reasonable expectation from a home product The blades are easy to replace I found the refills very easily on the Sephora website , 5 for the product working 1 for the lack of refills Very wasteful , I really like this razor for a quick dermaplane I took off 1 star because if refills are available I dont know where to find them Having to trash a perfectly good metal handle seems like such a waste , I really dont like it It gives me breakouts whenever I use it It makes my skin bumpy and irritated I highly suggest beauties not to buy this My skin was perfectly fine and clear but now I have breakouts around jaw line and neck  I wish I could go back and have never used it , Good weight and overall does a good job Refills seem hard to find though Overall helps me cut down on waste of buying the plastic ones , This does a great job at removing peach fuzz and hair I have not had any luck with this removing any dead skin bc its not high enough quality I assume , Love it and love that it comes in a case you can save it in works well to its great buy , FINALLY Ive been waiting years for something better than those awful plastic razors These work wonderfully I used to have to go over the same area multiple times with the plastic ones and they would overexfoliate my face and I would always break out afterwards With these one pass and I am good So much quicker and I no longer breakout after shaving my face , I read several reviews for different facial razors and this one is the best rated  Its a bit more of an investment up front but the quality is worth it  I had never shaved my face before and wanted to try as I have quite a bit of peach fuzz in front of my ear and down my jaw  This was an easy tool to use and I liked the weight of the metal  As other reviewers said hold at a 45 degree angle to the face  Dont go over an area too many times as this can leave your skin red and irritated  Recommend , Very impressed has a nice weight and it is very sharp a lot better than the plastic disposables ones  Would recommend , Jadore Efficace rapide et les poils ne repousse pas plus dure Beaucoup plus doux sur la peau que ceux  usage unique , Please be VERY careful when switching out the blades on this Sephora Collection Metal Facial Razor A week ago I was trying to get the old razor out which was extremely hard to do it was stuck I kept trying to get the blade out and cut my thumb REALLY bad I had to get 6 stitches Please everyone use extreme caution when doing this I am scarred for life cant even get myself to even look at this razor after that incident , Amazing razor I use this to get rid of the peach fuzz This razor is so amazing that one day I ran out of razors and shaved my whole leg with it lol Definitely worth the money  I will be buying more , The piece is a good weight comes with three extra blades Well worth it Would recommend Sephoras skincare tools are awesome , Great for removing vellous hair leaves skin so smooth I like to use this every 10 days or so to exfoliate and remove the peach fuzz from my face and neck as part of my nighttime routine Ill usually use nice nourishing actives and moisturizers afterwards to make sure my skin wont be irritated The blades are very sharp so I recommend just being mindful and taking your time on areas of contour like the jaw and around the nose Love that the blades are replaceable so much less wasteful than the disposable plastic razors , I have never written a review on Sephora before but I was so disappointed in this product I knew I had to review it I bought a cheap and cheerful one time use version of this at Target and that was LIGHT YEARS better than this one The Sephora Razor Collection one cut my face way easier than expected did not seem to dermaplane and now just a few days later my face feels dry and awful unlike what the Target version didwhat happens when I get my face professionally dermaplaned I would strongly caution you against buying this I am returning as we speak , Ive always been skeptical and wary of razors for shaving face but after reading the reviews on here I decided to try it  and boy was it good Im so happy I purchased this and the price was very reasonable too I like how easy it can be picked apart for cleaning in between shaving sessions Replacement razors are included as well , Highly recommend Fits nicely in the hand with a good weight , Such a great product and definitely a step in the right direction towards reducing waste I was just hoping that they sell refill separately and now they do Im so excited to keep using the same razor for years and just pay for the refills Thanks for listening to your customers Sephora great job , Amazing razor I used to have the plastic disposable ones and this is way better It gets a way better shave , Getting my first chin and jaw fuzzies and its not fun ladies I bought this one before I invested in an expensive one and Im glad I did It was very easy to use and my face felt smooth as a babies butt when I was done I used it right after a hot steamy bath and applying my night cream and then reapplied my night cream when I was done I was done in 10 minutes  I am not a graceful human being and I dont think theres anyway I couldve really hurt myself being careful I gave four stars instead of five because the blades are a little dull and seem like they wont last long However I also dont feel like I will slice myself by accident with theseHey Sephora please make in a smaller size for eyebrows Your eyebrow taming kit has one but the blade is too dull to be useful , Nicely weighted and razor itself is great quality Probably the best razor Ive ever tried before You dont need to shave many times bc its pretty sharp that helped me not get defeated skin and frictions by it I recommend you to put some shaving cream or something similar to shave with to protect your skin I always use aloe vera lotion to shave Its worth the price overall , This facial razor is such a game changer It glides through on my face removing the finest or shortest fuzz And it doesnt feel scratchy or irritate my sensitive skin I would never use another facial razor another , I love this At first I was skeptical since I have used the little dinky twinkle razors for years but man oh man This baby worked so much better I was always jealous when I saw a lot of people use them and they had a lot of hair coming off because the tinkle razors never gave me much pay out This razor not only got all the bits and gunk felt less sharp Im unsure if thats stupid but whenever I would do sensitive areas like the cheek closer to nose the tinkles would hurt and this felt fine I love the feel of the stainless steel blade because its weight kind of makes me use a much lighter hand I am usually too rough and heavyhanded whenever I shave my face I assure you this razor is SO much better  I did not want to waste so much plastic anymore so my only complaint is that sephora does not sell the refill razors separately because that would be incredible Im unsure if its a safetyliability or shipping issue but please please PLEASE sell the refills The only con is that they are sharp duh its a razor so be careful I did nick myself a couple of times but again I was hurrying and not pulling my skin taut enough , Blade is sharp which is great I was afraid that I would cut myself but as long as youre careful its fine I havent cut myself at all It has a nice weight to it while youre holding it in your hand Its nicely priced If I lost it I would buy it again , It does the job but the blades are a little dull , My skin was baby soft after using this The blade is very sharp so be careful Definitely use water or shave cream before using or youll get an irritating favor burn Nice heavy product , Giving this one star because although it works great Sephora hasnt restocked the razor refills Ive been waiting for refills for 4 months now and cant find similar refills from other sellers I ended having to buy plastic razors to suffice Kind of feels like a waste but cant return bc I used it for 3 months before running out , Ive been fighting with tweezers and the plastic little razors similar but so inferior to this I used it this morning for the first time and Im so impressed This is the best I love it My skin is so smooth and soft now Im so glad I bought it thanks to all the reviews before me , Heavy and precise I definitely recommend if you have a lot of peach fuzz on your face , Just the perfect facial razor Its a nice heavy duty metal razor with a nice little case and 3 replacement blades so it comes with four blades total one already on the razor It works so much better and smoother than those cheap plastic razors you get on Amazon and youre creating so much less waste this way Honestly this is one of my favorite beauty products Ive bought in 2021 I use it weekly and I wouldnt change a thing about it , Cant believe how much I could love a facial razor This has weight and makes it glide easier across your face I like it for the eyebrows too The blades seem sharper than the disposable ones they sell at the drugstore I prep my skin with moisturizer then go straight in This is a must have , WOW This is truly worth all the hype it gets in the reviews When I read the reviews I said to myself there was no way there could be that much of difference between this one and the disposables I get from the drugstore But there is such a difference I will definitely never use the drugstore ones again This gets rid of all the little peach fuzz in one swipe feels luxurious the handle is great and the weight of it truly helps It also doesnt leave my face irritated with redness and tiny little bumps like the others 1010 recommend totally worth the price , Worth the money The razor is heavy and durable with its stainless steel body and the backup blades it comes with are conscientious to people who do not want to have to purchase refills every few weeks The blades themselves are sharp and have not rusted for me , I used to use the cheap twinkle razors this is much sharper and gets much smoother result Love that they include some extra blades in initial purchase , Finally I found a razor that actually works This removes all peach fuzz and helped me get rid of some pesky milia as well , This is the best facial razor Ive ever used It got all the peach fuzz off and my face has never felt softer I was even tingly under my mask the following day It really gives the dermaplan effect and gets rid of dead skin , I really love this razor wand and blade Thought that Id be able to buy replacement razors but alas  it looks like Ill have to buy the whole thing over again  Which was the whole point of buying this in the first place LESS WASTE , absolutely love my husband enjoys it as well but unfortunately after you run out of the replacement blades theres no way to buy more you have to buy the whole set again which is a waste , This did absolutely nothing for me  I tried gliding softly I tried gliding harder Did NOT DO ANYTHING I was so hoping this was going to be a nice break from waxing all the time but alas I have a tool that is completely useless to me , Love this razor I love that its not plastics and has razor head replacements A great alternative as razors can be wastefulThe metal is heavy in a good way definitely feel like I have control Shaved very close to the skin for all those little fuzzies Would recommend to everyone I know , The best facial razor I have ever used I cant wait for the refill to come back in stock , This is heavy and bulky to use for me I expected this to be sharper than the little plastic ones I get from Amazon Its so not It did the job but the bulky heavy handle that is longer than others that I have used and a blade that was imo mediocre just didnt impress me I really wanted this to be the new razor that I loved to use I like the refill aspect and not using a disposable plastic face razor but I am going back to them The refills seem to always be out of stock for this but it does come with extras and a nice plastic case , I bought this Bc I have had my face professionally dermaplaned and loved the smoothness afterwards but didnt like some of the places she did a little high into my hair line etc Ive used the electronic trimmers that do a great job also and dont typically cause ingrown hairs like actual blades sometimes can I was skeptical of that when I purchased but its awesome no cuts or Knicks or ingrowns and I am in no way a professional Ive used it a few times now and its the best dermaplaning tool Ive ever tried comes with three extra replacement blades The reviews that said they were difficult to replace made me nervous but you just look for the clear plastic knotch at the top and it will come right out no slicing your hands open I use it with a sensitive skin serum on my skin and it glides over Go slowly and rinse it under warm water when its gunked up and the results have been worth the price tag 100 , i normally use those colorful drugstore face razors but THIS this is officially the best razor ive ever used i didnt know such a vast difference was possible i will use forever from now on , Much preferred to the plastic brow trimmers at the drugstore The blade is sharper and handle is more substantial Its also easier to clean and change blades I recommend using the smallest downward strokes against taut skin to dermaplaneit is super easy to slice yourself , I adore this razor Theres a HUGE difference between this razor and the tinkles that Ive been using for a decade This is sturdy quality and the blades dont get clogged as easily Im buying a few of these for backup and for stocking stuffers A product , Not to be dramatic but I would die for this razor Its amazing No drag The hair comes away so easily I used it dry on clean skin and my face feels like a baby BUY IT run dont walk , Super sharp  I love that they come with this case to keep it sanitary and the extra blades in a sanitary safe place , I tried the cheapy Amazon blades that nicked my chin and irritated my cheeks and then I upgraded to name brand choices that worked well but cost a small fortune  This little wonder tool is a gem  I always wipe it down after swiping and Im amazed by the amount of skin and cringe hair it removes  My face is so smooth and the blades last several uses so I dont end up having to buy refills very often  A total game changer and very very very easy to use , Rough chunky edges Looks and feels more like a saw rather than a razor Im glad I didnt buy extra blades , Always sterilize any instrument that goes on face The sleek design is very nice to grip and a even blade thats sturdy Very good for brows and peach fuzz Would highly recommend  , Great product I recommend applying a facial oil before using to reduce chance of any nicks or small cuts , This is truly life changing I have tried the cheap Amazon blades that are pret"
Metal Facial Razor Refills,"I agree with over reviewers that this isnt the same razors that come with the handle They do not slide in as easy and nicked my face in multiple places They are still a good option over the plastic razors Ill just have to be more careful with theses ones , I was tired of buying the cheap ones that you have to throw away then I found this product Its a quick and easy way to remove any hairs thats on my face I especially love it to shape my eyebrows , Be sure and view a YouTube on facial care If youve had it done professionally it is easy to do at home I would highly recommend , Love these Theyre simple to replace and use and a great price Im glad to not have to repurchase disposable plastic razors I have occasionally had trouble pulling the old blades out of the razor theres only a small raised bump to catch and push up from and Ive had it chip off before while removing But theyve never given me too much trouble Ive already repurchased , These refills are often out of stock so I purchase as soon as they are available  I love my Sephora metal razor and these razors are great getting my skin in good condition , Was excited for refills but the first batch I received are cutting my face fairly easily even if the skin is pulled tight Its almost like they are dull  catching my skin I dont know if Ill buy again bc new blades have nicked my face twice , These pair with the Sephora Metal Facial Razor its a great deal too I love less waste and it is better than disposable Also refills like this are easier on the ol wallet  yeahy , I love that I can replace the razor in my metal facial razor and not have to throw away single use razors , Great refill plus much better than the plastic razorsin my opinion , Amazing product with amazing quality I would highly recommend everyone to get it , Defective The refill blades have two pieces that form a cartridge These two pieces are supposed to be glued together however the glue is missing So the cartridges fall apart as soon as you remove them from the packaging They cannot be loaded into the razor and handling the separated blade is very dangerous I ordered three packages and all blade in all packages are defective , I ordered this and then had it replaced by Sephora and both orders arent blades They arent sharp at all and bend really easily its not the same blades I received with the original razor purchase , The freckles on my face are almost gone Im very surprised because Ive tried numerous scrubs sunscreens and makeup And nothing has worked My skin has an even complexion My only complaint is that there isnt a way to do this on other areas like my arms and chest Also I wish the blades lasted longer Other than that great product , LOVE I have tried many different razors and these are the best for both price and quality They are super sharp and dont irritate my skin at all 5 stars , I have tried many different facial razors and these are by I These are by far my FAVORITE I feel like I can go longer in between shaves when using these razors Please please please bring them back in stock , Hope these come back in stock soon I love this razor but only want to continue using it if Im able to get more refills , Finally But of course they are sold out Hopefully more soon , Love the razor  love how sharp the blades are My absolute favorite  only one I use , Im glad Sephora finally came out with these To clarify you get 6 replacement razors per pack not 3 like the description says One star off because my razors look like they have finger prints on them They should have been handled with gloves for hygienic purposes Its extremely important that something such as a metal razor blade be sterile , Okay I thought I was getting literally three razors But each pack has 6 razors so its 18 total I was pleasantly surprised I think Ill stock up before it inevitably sells out lol , Im glad theyre offering refills for the metal facial razor These are the same blades that come with the razor Good quality and last awhile A little hard to slide in and out of the razor though Im always afraid Im going to nick my finger , Yes Sephora actually listened I love this facial razor And I was a annoyed there was no refills But look here they are I love the feel of the razor in my hand It has a nice weight to it and very comfortable"
Mini Cleansing Wipes - Coconut Water,"I love the smell and feel of this makeup remover , Bought these twice and found them soft and workable for my makeup removal My to go stuff  , Sephora please publish my review OR update the product description10 WIPES would have been the perfect amount for travel when I needed them but NOWHERE in the description does it state that these are HALF the size of the regular wipes MY FACE DOESNT GET SMALLER WHEN I GO ON VACATION I will continue to use the regular ones , Wipes away more make up then any other wipes I have used Smells very clean and leaves my face soft and smooth , Yes these are soothing and relaxing and work good to remove makeup but they leave a weird smell , They seem fairly effective in removing makeup but the wipes are small so I needed 2 of them to remove a full face of makeup I took them on an 8 day vacation  had to run out to a store to buy more wipes , Love these  Im definitely going to buy them after getting a sample Theres nothing like a refreshing wipe to takeoff make up or just to freshen up mid day but the special thing about these is that they actually make your skin feel moisturized and healthy too Looking forward to trying the exfoliant  these are definitely a must have for gym goers yogis  or anyone who lives in a hot climate  , These are everything  I always have a pack in my purse but I especially love these for when I travel  They get all the airport grime off your face while leaving you refreshedplus they smell nice , These are the best travel size wipes ever Others are large and too bulky but these are perfect and fit inside the palm of your hands The wipes overall are smaller sized than your average makeup remover wipes but I love how compact these were I also purchased during the vib sale so for 20 off these are perfect Im going to stock up whenever I find them in sale again Im always looking for new ways to lighten my travel load and these are perfect , Best makeup remover Ive come across yet"
Mini Rose Quartz Facial Roller,"This product was probably an impulse buy I have been looking for a normal sized one to purchase but when I saw this at Sephora I had to get it It is very cute and ofc nice quality but I feel like a bigger one would probably be more worth itabigger one would just be , A bigger roller is definitely better if youre rolling your whole face but this mini size is perfect for the under eye area I stick it in the fridge when my eyes are puffy and I can definitely notice a difference after using it for a couple minutes , Well made but didnt feel like it did anything extra for my skin Just another tool that will be sitting in the back of my vanity , Love this but could be bigger I do think this is a fad product but I like the ritual and feeling of prepping myself Happy to find a cheap version , This product broke immediately out of the box I dont recommend it at all , This is a great little facial roller use it everyday and feels amazing , This was my first quartz roller and initially I didnt know what to expect I was pleasantly surprised though For the price and size of the product I really like it The smaller size actually fits better to the contours of my face and I very much enjoy using this as part of my daily routine , Well made feels much more expensive than it is Great small and inexpensive but thoughtful gift If youre worried about the size it is a mini roller But still great for eyes and all over face Rose quartz is better than jade because jade is a semiporous material which means that bacteria can get in and stay in even if washed , First time buying one of these  I like it Stays cool refreshing and Ive noticed a difference in helping with my puffy face I like to use with my serums , Great little tool Perfect size for me and rolls very easily , It stays cool even if not refrigerated  I find it relaxing too , I bought one for myself and my husband just because but we actually really like them They feel really good when used cold , It broke within a week of using it its squeaky and small , really small for the price i saw larger double sided ones for half this price in retail stores , Small but pretty good for the price Buy if youre looking to use it on smaller areas like the under eyes , this product was a bit smaller then i thought but its honestly a perfect size i use it with my moisturizer and roll it around my face and its got a nice cooling feel to it its also very durable i have dropped it a couple times thinking the stone would break and it did not overall fantastic purchase definitely worth the price since others are so expensive will buy again if needed lol , This overly priced item broke after 1 day Handle just snapped in half My teen was very disappointed , This really is a mini mini roller its okay but it couldve been cheaper Well see how well it hold upSpend the money get the regular size , its cute but they glue it in the packaging which is unnecessary so you have to try to get a glob of glue off of it when unpacking , Absolutely love it I was told you can use this with your serums or moisturizers I personally use it my serum and it feels amazing on my face even on its own its great But part of my routine I used it with serum  would definitely recommend everyone to try it with theirs , I waited a bit too long to try this out but once I did it broke in two days I started use of this just about a week ago and I purchased back in October when my roller was on its way out I went to pick up off my dresser and the handle feel right offbut the use I did get out of this I totally loved I might repurchase another one but jury is still out I honestly did not drop this or anything and treat all my facial products like gold and care for them as such so I was a little heart broken but hey it happens , This was my first time purchasing a facial roller I actually got the mini just to try a cheaper version to start Im glad I did because its the perfect size for the face I store it on a shelf in my bathroom where we keep our house at 71 and its always nice and cold every time I grab it to use It feels so relaxing on the skin and was much more effective with depuffing than I was expecting I use it after my serum before moisturizer So far Im loving it , It was so cute and it only made minor squeak sounds if you roll it really aggressively , I love this roller The size helps get in small areas Knocked a star because it is a bit squeaky but I dont mind , This facial roller is made from real stone and stays cool Unfortunately it squeaks terribly no matter how lightly I roll it If it wasnt for the squeaking I would give it 5 stars A great gift or lower price point to see if you like facial rolling , It being miniature makes it easier to get into creases , I do love the compact size but I would say its better for traveling than everyday use Only reason why Im giving it 4 stars is because it squeaks at times and the gold parts where it connects to the roller after one use have started to turn black , I didnt think it was worth the money for the size of it Its really tiny and not something I thought it would be I think its being falsely advertised , Size is pretty cute and versatile My only complaint is the quality of the product After only a few uses the roller is already rusty despite my efforts to properly clean and keep it tidy after every use  , The cooling was there and then the squeaky sound starts of the quartz rolling on the metal part  I also had left over product of it and the next day it appeared to turn navy right at the ends of the quartz roller  Im looking for a new one , Great product I love how it feels after a face mask treatment , Love this product used this with my cream very cold and good quality , What a LOUD tool It sounds like RUSTY mechanism Sephora needs to fix this asap It supposed to be a relaxing StressFree moment to massage my face Couic Couic Couic Couic in my ears Cant stand it , This roller is small but just the right size for the eye area I like keeping it in the fridge so its cool when I use it , Ive chewed wads of gum bigger than the roller on this thing , I wanted to try the roller craze  this is a good starter at a nice price Feels cool and makes for a soothing ritual even if its not doing much for me , Ive been looking for a jadequartz roller but all of them are SO EXPENSIVE this one is perfect for beginners like me It is mini sized but its just perfect for the eye area I love to put it in the freezer and apply my eye cream with it , Not a fan of how tiny it is It takes forever to feel like Im depuffing and circulating my blood well enough For 8 dollars maybe but for 12 Im returning , It is so tiny and cute The size is very nice for the face The stone feels cold and cooling as well I really like it Con would be that the portion where the stone rolls is metal on metal so it can squeak a little But it doesnt bother me  , This is small and cute and priced right Can do the same job as any of the other way more pricey rollers Feels so nice and cool and super smooth on your skin Winner"
Nourishing Moisturizer with Prebiotics,"I love this moisturizer its amazing keeps skin hydrated and also a good step in makeup just needs to be bigger , Very affordable and feels great No fragrance feels moisturizing but not too heavy I love this , my holy grail this moisturizer is sooo thick and your skin will drink it up I love it so much and its a 100100 in terms of any additives chemicals etc the only con is that it pills of your face if you scratch your face enough but for 18 with I , Not for me tho I have definitely try better ones , I decided to try this out because of the affordable price point I started using it at the same time as another new product and found my skin got dry and flaky quite quickly  I stopped using both then used them separately and didnt have the issue again so there must have been some kind of negative interaction with the ingredients  I would say the target user for this is probably in their teens and 20s I am neither  Its fairly light and has a slightly different consistency from my regular cream  Its hard to describe but yoghurt comes to mind You do need to make sure its well applied as initially it leaves a whitecast on the face if not absorbed enough  The jar itself is very light plastic so might be good for travel This may work well for others but for me I need something a bit more hardworking and would not repurchase , From the appearance of this cream it seemed like it would be too thickbut wow It just melts into the skin no greasy or heavy feeling Gives a perfect matte glow on the face , Worth your money my skin felt nourished especially after the shower when my skin is extra dry or sensitive planning on buying for the second time , this is a great great great moisturizer excellent hydration it feels great and really improves the skin visibly use by use I really look forward to using it and Im  not afraid of running out because I wont break the bank , I am a former sun lover and my boomer skin really craves moisture A LOT   This is my go to for a nice light moisturizer before sun screen and makeup   Now that its pollen season again  when I have been out and about I wash my face several times a day  and this moisturizer is the first thing that goes on my face after a water splash or makeup removal , I have incredibly dry and flaky skin due to eczema in the winter and Ive been trying to find a moisturizer that doesnt make my skin too shiny and oily and doesnt feel too thick but gives me great moisture This is one of the best moisturizers Ive ever tried and I really do mean it Its relatively light on the face doesnt make me feel too oily moisturizes nicely you might have to reapply sooner than some others and had absolutely no fragrances If you have eczema like me then this is an amazing facial moisturizer , I received this in my Allure Beauty Box and it really shocked me because it is actually filled completely to the top of the brim unlike most products that are half way empty they claim it needs room to expand or something No there is no waste of space here This also really surprised me by its very smooth texture It has a slightly mattifying effect so it improves the look and texture of your skin instantly No shininess It also is very moisturizing I use this mostly in the morning and by the end of my long work day 6am6pm my face doesnt end up an oily mess throughout the day Also havent experienced any breakouts at all My skin overall has really improved  Im really shocked by this Sephora branded moisturizer , I have only been using this product for about 4 days when I broke out in hives all over my face and had a burning sensation I am in the process now of trying to naturally calm the hives I brought this product but the ingredients are clean and it is fragrance free so I do not get irritation The product is moisturizing but not worth the allergic reaction Do not buy this product if you have sensitive skin or even normal skin Eventually you will break out I posted a picture of my cheek so you can see the how severe the reaction truly was Buyer beware , Love this I received a sample and after the first try I just love it Bought some for my mom and my sister , I received this in a beauty subscription box and with my combination skin I tend to go for gel moisturizer so I wasnt sure if Id like this moisturizer Looking at it I thought it was going to

, This moisturizer made my pores look bigger when I woke up the next morning after applying before bedtime I tried it again a few days later to see if had the same effect and it did So I used iit on my neck instead on my , This was an average moisturizer and you get what you pay for I have combination skin and this worked well for me before I put on SPF , I have oily skin Sometimes oilycombo This

other products Greasy Not for me , I like this moisturizer It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized I love the rich texture of it and it has exceeded my expectations , I liked the product and how it felt on my skin but I have combination skin and tend to sweat a lot so I think the prebiotics amplified my clogged pores and acne so it just wasnt a good fit for me but I think it works for others , another product I bought for the first time during the holiday sale and Im so impressed with the whole sephora collection  everything Ive bought has been good quality and in so glad I got to try out so many things during their sale , Tried this one after being a long time lover of the Sephora Collection Nourishing Moisturizer  Hydrate  Repair  3 oils after it was discontinued Didnt like

using this from more than a year It has visibly reduced my dark circles but more than that it has helped a lot in reducing puffiness of eyes Quantity is pretty good for the price Im going to have my 3rd box , I literally never write reviews but this moisturizer ruined my skin Ive never had very acneprone skin I usually get a massive pimple or two on my chin but nothing horrible I used this product once a day for 2 weeks and it made my skin break out HORRIBLY All over my face not just the usual chin I have normal to mildly dry skin and the only thing I changed with my skin care routine was this Im disappointed but after seeing other reviews it looks like Im not alone , Perfect moisturizer for normal to dry skin like me here in Canada , finally found a great cream  doesnt clog my combo skin  and helps with the dry patches  the piling everyone talks about is just the dead skin coming off in my case at first  I love that it doesnt break the bank and it is just as nice as the expensive creams   Please dont change a thing , This feels moisturizing at first but after like 2 hours it starts falling of your face It like comes off with your makeup too if you put it under your makeup as a base I gave it a try for 3 weeks and now I am just throwing it out  Theo , I tried this instead of my usual Kiehls moisturizer and have regrets It was moisturizing but broke me out pretty good after the first couple uses  , Its okI heard great things about this moisturizer but unfortunately it flakes off on my face even though it is very moisturizing , I have extremely sensitive dry  acne prone skin and I was afraid this might break me out but I think its helped my skin Its fragrance free but has a little bit of a weird smell but once its rubbed in it goes away Better than some high end moisturizers Im3 tried , This moisturizer was recommended for me by a sephora employee for my skin and it caused me to breakout so badly that now I dont have self esteem anymore DONT RECOMMEND , Super impressive Not only is this moisturizer rated high as not toxic and safe in my app that I check products for dangerous ingredients but it works so well I was using a Tatcha moisturizer in the purple container that I loved but actually love this one better which is a huge plus because its A LOT more affordable My normal to dry skin loves it Leaves a soft firm non greasy feel Ive been using a month now and no breakouts doesnt feel heavy its moisturizing lines are softer and my skin is glowing I will purchase again , Felt good on my skin loved that it was unscented but caused breakouts on my skin for whatever reason My unscented body lotion has been better for my face , I love this moisturizer Ive been trying to find a good consistent one and this one works great Ive seen my skin get noticeably softer and smoother I have combination textured skin  , Really good lightweight but moisturizing formula  I use this every daynight I have very dry skin and this is perfect for the summer  I do prefer the old formula though But I would buy this one again , What a mess Maybe I just got some from a bad batch The texture was terrible It was like partially dried rubber When I put it on my face it pilled something fierce and let my skin feeling drier It also left an unpleasant feeling residue Absolute waste of money I chucked it after a few uses , Moisturizing with feeling heavy Its my new fav face cream , This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used and at such a friendly price Dont sleep on this My dry sensitive acne prone skin drinks this up Ive even noticed that my acne is clearing up since using this havent changed up anything else which is interesting as there arent really actives for that in here must have repaired my skin barrier or smth Been using this day and night , Purchased this for my teenage daughter and she loves it Also it is unscented but works great for her face and she used to break out easily due to the dry state we live in but this product helps with keeping her face moisturize , Broke me out so bad It felt oily and heavy after a while , Very light and hydrating  I have very dry skin and loved how this absorbed into my skin It felt very light and airy I didnt notice any issues with it pilling as other reviews said I would buy this again for sure , I am so impressed I have been using Kiehls for a long time but it was not always giving enough hydration This cream feels light on the skin but also your skin feels happy and not tight I use it only at night about 2x a week because I also use tretinoin on other nights I cannot comment how it wears during the day or under makeup because I have never used it this way I am very happy with this cream especially considering the price I meanit is nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do  I will be repurchasing , I have had extremely sensitive skin my entire life add to that 2 years ago I was diagnosed with rosacea So its even worse now I gave this Sephora Nourishing Moisturizer with Prebiotics a try and it is my new standard I have had no negative reaction at all and tons of positive It is moisturizing without clogging After using this my skin feels so happy For the reviewers that said it is not moisturizing enough for them  I find that this works good for me when I use a different moisturizer twice a week I cant use the other moisturizer all the time or else Ill break out with acne and this one alone was not enough moisture So what I do is use this regularly and one or two days a week Ill use another moisturizer when I go to bed at night All fixed Now Im just perfect Hope this helps someone , This is a rebuy for me I used Khiels Avocado eye cream for years But it was just a great moisturizer that didnt run into my eyes One day I noticed after using this for about a month that I wasnt slathering on the under eye concealer as much and actually realized my forever dark circles have lightened Bonus its affordable and doesnt irritate my eyes Wears beautifully with make up , I love the texture of this product the coverage and how nongreasy it feels Its perfect for combining with my other skincare products like borage oil or ascorbic acid from The Ordinary and has not broken me out at all It also really helps my skin not look shiny from oiliness and dehydration , I used this cream daily for over 2 weeks  I can see the diffense after few days its very light weight and the coverage is great , I love this moisturizer It isnt anything that fancy but it definitely does the job and moisturizes your skin A lot of moisturizers have broke my skin out in the past but this one is totally a safe option for acne prone skin I definitely recommend if your just looking for a simple and nice moisturizer , Good moisturizer but it pills Not a good one for layering Also its take a long time to be absorbed by the skin , Literally my favourite moisturizer ever Ive been using the Sephora collection moisturizer for years and it seems as though they changed the formula but its still great I have dry sensitive skin and this moisturizer leaves me hydrated without feeling greasy or sticky , By itself this product is nice However when you Layer it with other things it pills Thats not what a good moisturizer does , Its a great moisturizer but it pills REALLY bad Be careful when layering products on top of this moisturizer because it will pill Otherwise its a great moisturizer it gives my dry skin a boost of hydration , Feels greasy on the skin and takes a long time to stop feeling icky Pills really easily and noticeably Not a lot of moisturizing properties  it just feels like it sits on top of the skin , Ive only been using this for a couple of weeks but love it so far Super hydrating and leaves my skin so soft , Great for moisture overnight but it pills way too much to wear through the day or under makeup , Really like this product my skin is really smooth and it feels so hydrating , My skin was dry and rough before I started using this Now its smooth and glowing 1010 , Lightweight cream moisturizer that gets the job done It isnt greasy or too thick and feels like it absorbs quickly Everything is great EXCEPT it pills crazily so I only use it at night It also came with a rather large air pocket in the container so it wasnt all the way full , Hydrates without being greasy A perfect moisturizer in every way , Im not a fan of the new formula either I was using the previous version 30 nourishing oils moisturizer and loved it I was excited to try this because it is fragrance free but sadly this falls flat for me It feels greasy on my face and does not feel like it moisturizes very well its the only change in my routine as Im noticing dry red patches coming up around my mouth and chin I wish the old formula was still available , I have purchased this product a few times and have been happy with the price and the results It is not greasy absorbs quickly and lasts all day , The formula has changed from the previous version that had the orange square on the front This new version stings my sensitive skin feels thick and sticky like Ponds day cream but still leaves my skin feeling DRYER Please bring back the old formula , At first I was a bit iffy about buying this product after a couple reviews Ive seen however I decided to go for it I love it  Ive been using it for about a week now and it has made my skin so much better Im currently on tretinoin and that would make my skin flake so bad specially around my mouth but I have not experienced any flaky skin since ive started using this moisturizer It doesnt feel heavy or greasy on the skin but it does give that dewy hydrated look I have mostly oily skin but I love this moisturizer , Bought this because I was tired of spending so much  on tiny tubes of moisturizer Its really great The price is just a bonus It absorbs quickly but makes my sensitive skin feel moisturized Its not super thick but I have pretty dry skin and I am happy with it I would probably get something thicker if youre really dry though Great for summer , I bought this to replace my Sephora moisturizer that had almost identical packaging However the actual product itself is nothing like the original and its watered down Saddened that I now have to find a new moisturizer , I have a few issues with this moisturizer1 It isnt very moisturizing It doesnt really do anything for my skin2 It pills on my face I use this with a serum underneath and nothing on top3 It smells like rubber or plastic or something similar to me Not a pleasant smell                      I DO NOT recommend it , I have super sensitive combo skin and my skin barrier easily gets disrupted This moisturizer has not only been great in building back my skin barrier but also doesnt cause me to break out Im so impressed that I didnt have to spend a ton of money to get these results Plus I love how this doesnt include any silicones , I experience pilling regardless of the product I use before this I have a pretty simple nighttime routine gentle toner hyaluronic acid and retinol I regularly use FAB ultra repair cream and versed dew point gelcream and used to use Cera Ve None of those have had any pilling ever with the other products but this one ALWAYS pills  I am probably going to return it On a positive note it has a good consistency and is gentle and I dont think I have experienced acne from it but o cant stand the pilling , The best ever Amazing amazing amazingn full coverage doesnt leave your face feeling gross hydrates amazing , Please bring back the other nourishing moisturizer formula 3 Oils This one does not feel quality and definitely does not moisturize my skin I had to buy the gift set where a tiny sample of it comes with my preferred AMA face wash that I also like better than the PBT face wash This must work for a different skin type but its not a replacement for the one that was the nourishing moisturizer before , I bought this by mistake I wasnt paying attention and I thought I picked up the eye cream but what a happy mistake it was I have combination skin and suffer from hormonal acne This leaves my skin glowing happy and so moisturized Ive only been using it for two weeks and my boyfriend keeps commenting on how good my skin looks 1010 , I was disappointed it smells bad and my skin is still so dry I wont buy again , I can tell this is a nice moisturizer overall but it just doesnt work for my skin type It kind of reminded me of Ceraves cream which is also a good one but since I have acneprone skin products that are free from oils work best from me like waterbased face lotions I noticed some pores around my chin beginning to fill up so I stopped using it If you have dry skin that isnt acneprone this could work well for you , THANK YOU SEPHORA FOR CHANGING THE FORMULA This is an excellent example what happens when a company actually listen to what their customers need The new formula is not only more hydrating they added more skin identifying ingredients AND it is now fragrance free Fragrance free is so so important for so many different kind of problematic skin making this a fragrance free product means this is now so much more accessible for different skin type  This is definitely my new staple goodbye Kiehls , Fell in love with this I cannot believe how affordable this skin line is My skin is on the oiler side and this felt amazing on my face I didnt look oily at all just felt super hydrated Ill definitely be buying this again , I bought it during spring sale event and not regretting it was using FAB collagen cream and skin was feeling tight and dry  sometimes not alwaysthis really is a nice moisturizer and  affordable too i  have combination skin so till now in this weather its not oily at allcant say will be the same in summer toobut will recommend to someone with combo skin , love this great formula even for my sensitive skin has a nice dewy finish and doesnt feel too heavy only wish is that it came in a larger size and ideally a tube for sanitary reasons great value for the price , YEARS And I mean YEARS and thousands of dollars later of trying to find products for my dry hypersensitive and reactive skin This whole time sephora was creating this gold mine of a product First aid beauty has nothing on this formula and actually FAB products gave me one of the worst breakouts of my life This is literally the best moisturizer ive ever used My skin looks amazing and is glowing from the inside out I am forever grateful for this product I use it with the firming eye cream and glow serum it is simply a chefs kiss Dont think about it just buy it for real , Its really good for dry skin I would recommend it , This moisturizer works really well to keep my skin from feeling dry or tight under my foundation during the day I often layer it over a face oil before bed , Very great moisturizer for the cost It has a decently thick consistency and absorbs very well into skin I will continue to purchase for a more affordable moisturizer option , not loving the new formula with prebiotics  still has the same texture but my skin feels tighter and not softer  smoother like it was beforeI hope they bring back the old nourishing moisturizer formula with the 3 oils , This is a great product for the cost I would not say it is the best moisturizer Ive ever used but it is great for the cost It works great with my sensitive skin and it is not caused any reactions Besides that it feels nice on the skin and is my go to travel moisturizer , This is so much better than the previous version without PBT This version doesnt have a fragrance where the old one did , Suffering from extremely sensitive skin I risk it all trying a new product Luckily this moisturizer did wonders for me I use it both day and night after my serums thinnest to thickest I call this the DE dupe but doesnt make you breakout or leave the feeling of film left on the face , This moisturizer is life changing Defiantly the best moisturizer I have ever purchased and obviously the price is fantastic I have minor acne and I can say that this really helped clear up my skin small bumps and less deep breakouts I love that this product is made in France Will be purchasing again , I wanted to love this because the price is amazing but unfortunately it actually caused my skin to have dry and red patches on my eyelid and chin It took me a couple of weeks to figure out the cause but it was unfortunately this Wanted to love it , Not a fan I bought this because of all the good reviews and I was searching a for a cheaper moisturizer I have dry acne prone skin and it seems like my skin is getting worse I had a few pimples here and there but I keep waking up to little pimples all over my face everyday I dont not recommend , If it were possible to rate 0 stars I would I honestly have never left a review on any product before but after my disappointment to finding out theyve changed the formula from the original I absolutely HAD to Mainly with wishful thinking that enough people agree  they bring it back ugh Everything about this is in no comparison to the original I hadnt realized it changed until after I went to repurchase as usual after using it I noticed it wasnt the same shortly thereafter upon research I came to be right The original not only ACTUALLY hydrated  nourished your skin for you to feel you could see it as well It gave a glass skin finish cleared up blemishes  rejuvenated skin all in one From personal experiences the amount of compliments I got on my skin using the original moisturizer was outstanding Not to mention the look on peoples faces when I told them that it was Sephoras very own collection  the price for it as well was absolutely priceless PLEASE bring back the OG maybe this new formula will work for others but I believe the original should still be available for purchase , this moisturizer is exactly what i wanted its lightweight and a great texture its suuper hydrating and i have noticed my skin feeling bettersofter since ive started using it i love it , I really love this moisturizer especially overnight Its got almost a whipped texture to it and it blends in nicely It doesnt feel heavy on the skin and leaves me feeling hydrated For the price of this product you cant go wrong , The previous formula of the Nourishing Moisturizer was so much better  it was the only moisturizer I used for years it made my skin feel amazing and never broke me out  This new version with prebiotics leaves my skin feeling dry and tight   Will not repurchase , Im so sad I miss the 30 3 oils nourishing moisturizer Please bring it back This does not work as well as the other one did It was my holy grail the past year and Im almost out of my last jar , Having dry to normal skin this moisturizer left my skin feeling dry and tight Wasnt as moisturizing as I would have liked will be returning unfortunately , So I used the old version of this product for the last year or two because Im poor and it was actually really good so I was concerned when they changed it into this Its fine I dont think its AS rich as the old version I think they replaced the base oil that the ingredients are suspended"

few weeks to leave a review At just 16 it has now replaced my old nightly routine face cream I can say with confidence , I received this product complimentary from Sephora in exchange for my honest review I have combination skin but I like to use a thicker cream or mask occasionally when my skin is dryer I also used this one on my handscuticles overnight with a pair of cotton gloves They are VERY dry in the winter and they were so soft in the morning This is a fairly thick cream and it does not absorb in my experience but sits on top of the skin as an occlusive A full pump was more than enough for my face and neck or a thicker layer on my hands It worked well over other serums because it kind of holds everything in on your skin  You can also use it alone as a quick treatment mask and just wipe off any excess after 10 minutes It left my skin feeling soft but just a tad greasy Thats fine in the morning because Im going to wash my face anyway This is not a product I would use every day but its great for dehydrated skin , This mask is doing amazing things for dry skin You will get a lot of what higher end products tend to offer Truly hydrating and very gentle on my oily skin Love

Pores Target Serum,"This serum really does help loosen blackheads so they come out of my pores more easily I like the silky smooth texture and how nice it smells too , After using this product for a week it broke me out so bad dont recommend , After 23 weeks of using this serum I broke out more than usual ONLY bc its been a while I havent used BHA On my 4th week my skin began to clear up Now its been a little over 2 months and I love my skin , This is a good product but wasnt working with my sensitive rosacea skin I think it would work much better for non sensitive skin I did notice improvements so I gave it 3 stars , I was looking for a budget BHA serum after my cosmetologist recommended it for pores and while I didnt notice a huge difference in my pores with this specific serum I did notice a huge one in texture my skin was so much smoother A lot of smaller pimples on the forehead were gone which I loved , Made my skin breakout I have sensitive skin though so had to throw it away , Nice to use great smell great package but no effect on skin , I have KP on the sides of my cheeks that have never ever gone away Only 3 days into using this product I see a difference in the bumps on my cheeks and the blackheads on my nose It feels super gentle on my skin as Im a teen but I love it because of its affordability and effectiveness I would so purchase this product again Its not sticky or heavy and you can use for AM or PM LOVE , Ive been using this for awhile an I can see a difference in my pores specially my nose area , I put it on to help with my pores and targeted pimples since I have a oily tzone and it does it job I put it on in the evening before my moisturizer , LOVE this serum It works so much better for me than Paulas choice I like to use a steamer on my face so the serum penetrates as deep as possible I have repurchased twice its a great staple , I LOVE this stuff I am 22 years old and have fairly normal skin except in my tzone where I can be oily and have large pores A Sephora employee suggested this to me and I noticed a difference the first time using it within minutes After only a week my pores are so small and this stuff makes my skin feel and look tighter as well I use it in my nightly skin routine but I believe you can use it day night or both I just suggest a sun screen if you use it during the day just to be safe I couldnt recommend this more to someone who has large or notixeable pores , Omg a must have This product is so much efficace to minimize pores for men Buy it for sure , Definitely helped clean out pores I just finished the first bottle and repurchased I recommend , Ive been using this along with the enzyme serum and finding Im getting really great results My skin is pretty sensitive and the combo doesnt even cause me redness which is very rare , AHAs and BHAs are some of the best chemical exfoliators you can use for your skin Im always on the lookout for a new way to incorporate these key ingredienets in my skincare Unfortunately most products on the market are full of other filler ingredients and have a minimal amount of the acids to be really effective This serum is a great way to clear out the pores and even out my complexion With chemical treatments you do need to wait a few weeks before youre able to see any results So far my results are great I havent had any adverse reactions to this product and it seems to be working great on my super sensitive skin I will continue using this product for more long term results , Feels great on skin and does its job Please make it available as a larger

product  It does nothing for my skin  I have combination oily with enlarged pores on cheeks and nose and I see no difference at all after using it for several weeks  Too bad I purchased 2 of these waste of money , I used it for 3 now days It wasnt suitable for my skin I got acne with it I dont recommend this product as if you have sensitive skin it would make it worse Better to buy a little more expensive product thats safe for your skin , This product completely changed my skin texture and helped heal any acne scaring It made a noticeable difference within the first week of using I had a really bad break out on my cheeks and chin and it cleared it up and prevented more pimples Have tried many high end skin care products and nothing touches this one Will buy this product over and over again , An underwhelming product I used a whole bottle and saw zero change in my skin My pores didnt decrease in size and blackheads didnt clear up or get any better Literally no changes after using a full bottle Didnt break me out or irritate me but didnt do anything positive either The new Sephora brand resurfacing peel mask Works 100x better  Skip this and try the mask , Ive been using this serum every night for just over 2 weeks and have already noticed great improvements My pores appear slightly smaller but the biggest change has been in my skins oil production I have extremely oily skin and can use anywhere from 48 oil sheets a day depending on the temperaturehumidity and what I doing during the day outside more than inside etc I have noticed huge reduction in the oiliness of my skin and now just use about 2 oil sheets a day I do think other products in my skin care routine help but this serum has been an amazing addition to my routine , Bad quality Stays on the skin and never gets reabsorbed It caused me to break out on my cheeks and chin where I rarely ever get acne Clogged my skin pores and just stayed on the surface Also caused milia below my eyes Smells old and not fresh I cannot trust this product It is not clean either I doubt Sephora will post my review because I am writing it with all honesty , Saw results after the first use Has made my skin smoother and pores definitely tighter Also smells great Highly recommend , This stuff is amazing i have very large pores and seems like nothing is helping to my desired results and ive tried a lot but this stuff is great it mattifies my skin and instantly shrinks my pores and also seems like my makeup goes on great after too very very happy  , always looking for clean products and this is simply great I dont apply it all over my face but only where I have visibly large pores and follow with a moisturizer and it gives a beautiful canvas like texture I love it I especially use it on my neck area , Not too harsh on the skin but made me break out so badly in areas where I usually dont even get zits , smell good and doesnt feel sticky on the skin but it didnt do anything for me , Il est bien  Cependant pour le sbum au visage  je prfre le niacinamide  , I have oily skin and struggled a lot with flaky skin on my nose but this is my new holy grail Its my first BHAPHA product and now I get the hype lolI saw results the very next morning after applying it before night the first time , Been using for about a week and I am IN love For me I noticed drastic changes in my pores redness and overall texture Only giving 4 starts because I havent been using long but I think I will have to stock up on this , Wow I think this is my new holy grail Its still too early for me to rate 55 but so far this made my skin look and feel amazing with no makeup on I have large pores and sometimes bumps and my skin is so smooth now Love this stuff will be rebuying , I love this stuff I love the clean smell  pretty much no odor but I still like it and it cleans and clears my pores nicely Also it absorbs so fast into my skin You should put on moisturizer right after this stuff for perfect skin , I purchased this to help with my blocked pores blackheads and acne I use tretanoin so Im careful how and when I apply this This has a dropper the serum is a cloudy fluid with some slip it glides on the skin nicely I apply this only to my T zone and to treat milia under my eyes After 2 weeks this serum is helping my other skin care to clear clogged pores and blackheads I noticed this evening that I couldnt see a single blackhead on my face I do use a thick moisturizer to help prevent overly drying my skin , This is my first review on Sephora ever after being customers for over 20 years but I just wanted everyone to know how awesome this serum is and hopefully they will never stop making it I have REALLY LARGE pores and very oily skin and no skincare and makeup ever works to correct it or cover it After spending money on a 140 serum which of course didnt work I saw this on the website and its only 20 so I was like whatever I would just try IT WORKS I have been using it for over a month now and my pores are obviously smaller Believe me I am obsessed with my pores and have few different mirrors just to check them out all day Now I can still see some pores when I look closely but they look average like Ive seen on other people faces and not gigantic like before My foundation goes on a lot smoother and my face is also less oily Seriously just try it and give it about a month to see the result I use 5 drops on face , I purchased this pore serum about 2 months ago when i started to take my skincare seriously again and I just love it I put it on day and night and have seen a noticeable difference in my nose and forehead pores BUT it did take about a month to see actual results so if youre only using it for a week or two and expect a miracle this product is not for you But if youre a slow and steady wins the race type this serum will be perfect for you , Effets visibles rapidement Mme mes proches voient la diffrence Diminution de la grosseur et de la profondeur de mes pores Rduction de lapparence des cicatrices Seulement quelques gouttes sont ncessaires , I have been using for a month now I sometimes wear it once a day morning or night or twice morning and night I love everything about it I love the dropper Literally FAB products or Farmacy droppers suck and here we have a sephora product with an amazing dropper I love the smell I think it has helped my pores so much no more black dots on my nose Please try it and try it longer than 2 weeks in case youre purging it happened to me kinda wanted to stop using I recommend 1000000 , I was really hoping this was the answer to my enlarged pores I tried this on my right cheek and nose so that I could compare to my left side Unfortunately it actually accentuated my pores and the area became a little bumpy I stopped using it after a week because I was afraid it might actually get worse So disappointed , I have very oily skin This is one of the only products that will keep my oils at bay all day long Such a great product Id give it ten stars if I could , This is the best exfoliating serum that Ive used Ive been using it for 3 weeks and the blackheads are gone My acne is also under controlMy skin looks clear now Plus it did not burn or make my skin feel stripped Love it , I have very problematic skin  super oily cystic acne scars fine lines large pores etc  so I have low expectations for most products that arent prescription meds But I gave this a try during a sale and am so happy I did I apply 3 drops in the morning after cleansing pressing it in and letting it dry Within days I saw a very noticeable improvement in skin texture and reduction of sebaceous filaments I had been using a 2 sa product but I believe bumping up to 6 made a big difference Will most definitely buy again , Really love this product I can really see the difference in my pore size and the result was almost immediate Great , Sp worth it It shrank my pores and cleared up my skin I used this with the glycolic acid peeling glow pads and my skin had changed within one week of using it , I use it every morning Works fine under makeup with no pilling It dries matte and feels nice on the skin Best part I never get pimples anymore Its going to take a while for me to go through it so for 20 its an amazing product , Ce produit me donne de plus grosses pores je naime vraiment pas le rsultat Trs ngatif ,

where this serum is more drying My skin feels so smooth and soft after use Best Sephora Collection product Ive tried yet I will buy this again and again , Im in my early fifties and have never user a serum before I am truly amazed at the difference in the pores on my face My problem areas were the pores on the top of my nose down the sides and a bit on the face and above my eye brows Ive been using it for a little over six weeks I have a dramatically noticeable reduction in the pores on my nose the biggest problem area Slight reduction on my face and over the eye brow areas Ive used about 34 of the bottle But I was generous with the amount I used some nights Normally I used one dropped full a night and put it on my whole face and part of my neck In the morning my face feels so smooth and when I wash my face it isnt icky feeling like some face creams can make it feel It absorbers quickly Sometimes Ive added a face cream too with no issues  Im getting ready two put two bottles in my cart I dont want to run out , I picked this up a few weeks ago and use it as part of my nighttime skin routine It doesnt cause me any irritation and I use it in combination with a very gentle daily retinol with no problem It is a bit of a thick formula and I do see myself going through it quickly but its at a price point I dont mind repurchasing more frequently I like that its gentle enough for daytime use as well and may use it for that in the summer when my skin is more oily"

face handles it well 12x a week as needed without irritation It does leave me with a noticeable cooling sensation while it is on and after I wash it off but it doesnt feel uncomfortable to me Just refreshing Definitely recommend , Well its a super nice product I guess I was rather confused as I thought this was a peel mask as in peel off which I was looking for  Still I do love the results and the product so giving a 5 star , love love love this cleared up my skin up so fast i swear by this now , The product itself is good but the packaging is horrible After using this mask for few weeks it stopped pumping  I felt the bottle is still heavy and i knew that cannot be that I used it all I opened the bottle and there are plenty of product still there Now I feel that the freshness is compromised because I opened it , WOW JADORE  Jai jamais aussi ressentie mon visage aussi propre , I was looking to buy The Ordinary AHA BHA peel but since its not sold in Canada anymore I was recommended this peel It does make skin feel softer after using it but I havent seen any major difference , I have pretty sensitive skin and this didnt hurt at all  first use and my skin is softer and tighter  Pores reduced in size after first use as well  , This peel is awesome My skin is so much smoother now Ive been using this for about 2 months now once or twice a week Its cleared up my texture and small breakouts so nicely My skin looks and feels smooth This has been a game changer for me The instructions are clear and easy to follow so if youre new to peels this would be an easy start , I saw instant results from using this mask just after the first time Which I must say when it comes to most skincare products in general is very hard to come by This mask gave my skin a healthy radiance to it made my skin look brighter and helped with reducing the appearance of my enlarged pores in certain areas of my face as well It also made my skin look smooth and plump too However best of all it does not irritate my skin like crazy like most chemical peels do It does go on with a bit of a cooing sensation nothing major and it rinses off very nicely without any leftover residue at all I currently do own 2 bottles of this stuff and most definitely plan to keep buying it for sure As this product is definitely one that no matter if you are a teenager or a grown adult you should definitely pick up and add to your skincare regimen today , My skin had a recent flare up of dry flaky enlarged pores with congestion that no amount of exfoliating was helping I used this within the

and Im glad I did because I like this better I dont have sensitive skin so others may have a different experience but I didnt feel any tingling or burning with this It actually left my skin feeling physically cooled after use as if it had peppermint in it it doesnt so Im not sure what caused that but it felt great My skin is smoother and this is a great chemical exfoliant , aprs avoir utilis  ce produit ma peau est lisse et lallure des pores est rduite  On dirait une peau de bb  , Skin felt smooth and soft after using Slight tingling but not uncomfortable Excellent value for performance , I used to use one from Murad called intensivec and loved it and I was totally lost when they discontinued it This has come in at a fraction of the price delivering the same results in my opinion Very happy with this , A good product I definitely have seen an improvement in my skin but nothing drastic Suitable for sensitive skin reasonable price and the recyclable packaging is a plus as well , amazing packing this is the first time I have ever tried a skin care product and my skin feels amazing It is super easy to spread Though I dont know why my skin felt minty after washing my face overall a good product , Dont know what the heck this has done besides nothingive seen not one bit of differencevery disappointed as I believe a product should work as advertised and do what it is suppose to dowill of course not buy againdont recommend , I bought this on a whim as an aside to some other products not thinking too much about it other than knowing how much I like Sephora Collection quality and the price tag turned out to be the star item in my order I recently had an infection on top of my nose that left some hyperpigmentation and scarring and with each use of this cream it gets a little lighter It also leaves my skin butter soft got rid of a bunch of milia and uneven texture along my jawline from another bad product and overall it just works Ive been using it every other day without any issue and feel like my skin is now maintained if you will Give it a try , Pretty good It is not super irritating and has this cooling feeling even after you wash it off I use it once a week and I think is a good way to get the deep icky stuff out of my skin from wearing makeup all week giving this great deep clean feeling I also have super dry skin and this is one of the few resurfacing type masks that doesnt dry my skin out super bad I will for sure buy again once I run out , FEELS SO GOOD My skin is sensitive and tolerated this very well Feels nice and cool when you rinse it off and leave the skin absolutely glowing , To be honest it doesnt do much for my skin it didnt get my skin smoother or brighter its just the same So will not buy again But I have to say that I have very sensitive skin and it doesnt irritate at all , Very gentle peel mask It works well and the price is amazing it is not irritating and it is acne prone skin safe I use it one every two weeks as my skin is sensitive but I recommend , Absolutely love this mask I have combo skin mostly sensitive and dry and I get occasional acne that is hard to treat because my skin is pretty dry already This mask is great It does exactly what it says it will and it doesnt overly irritate my sensitive skin Ive noticed a great difference in the texture and dullness of my face already and Ive only been using once a week for a few weeks If you have very sensitive skin be careful Always spot test first of course , Love this I use it 23 times a week and it makes my skin feel so amazing Noticed a difference in my skin and pores after my 3rd time using it Definitely be careful if you have sensitive skin with this one though , I like to say my skin has a sense of humor Its oily and sensitive and prone to allergic reactions just to keep things interesting This peel left my skin feeling firm and smooth with no nasty rash or lingering irritation Its only very mildly scented which makes it a re keeper for because you guessed it I have scent allergies , First photo March 13 2022 second photo todayI have normalsensitive and dehydrated skin 20 years oldI have tried many exfoliating masks and this is the only one that has made me see results on my skin I leave it on for 15 minutes and rinse it off with warm water I use it at night 3 times a week  My skin texture has improved a lot and I have seen a reduction in the appearance of my red scarsI dont want you to think that one product makes all the difference Diet contraception sun exposure and stress are factors that have a big influence on our skin I changed my diet eating lots of fruits vegetables and drinking lots of water I changed contraception I switched from the IUD to the pill and I spent a lot of time outside with a good sunscreen It can be very easy to spend a lot of money on products expecting to see a difference after a few days but its important not to upset our skin too much with new products every week and find a good routine that suits you and stick to it No need to have 20 products in a routine , Ive read great reviews about this product so thought I would give it a try As soon as you put it on it does feel a bit cool and tingles a bit but once you take it off your skin feels so smooth , Seems to be working I feel like my skin has developed some sort of resistance so I have to leave it a little longer to actually see the benefits but I love how renewed my skin feels once I wash it off , I have sensitive acne prone skin and love this product I do find I can not leave it on for more than 5 minutes so I apply it right before my showers and it does such a great job removing all the surface debris on my face I have recommended this product to many of my friends and we all love it , Love this Not too potent but leaves me glowy the next day Easy to apply doesnt smell and easy to rinse off Price is great  Sephora Collection products are severely underrated I use it twice a week and Ive noticed my skin is brighter and some of my acne scars have been fading substantially , If you have acne prone skin with post acne red marks do not hesitate I have fairly sensitive skin and this did not irritate me at all This has helped me so much and its so reasonable for the price You wont regret trying , I loved the DE Baby Facial but I can only buy it if I goto the US its not available in Canada due to the high  of AHABHA same with the Ordinary Got this and I must say for 14 of the cost of DE its very comparable It smells better than the DE version it doesnt sting as much I found my skin is just as dewy and glowy after , For the price the results its amazing With the sale twice a year its just a staple  , I love this mask I was debating several different choices and am glad I went with this one  I will reorder for sure  I love the consistency and the way my skin feels after I use this , amazing , I actually bought this peel mask in store before there were any online reviews I just finished my first bottle and picked up my second This peel mask is really gentle so if you have sensitive skin it would be good for you It has a minty cool feeling when you let it sit on your skin For more exfoliating power I actually leave it on longer than what the bottle says I use it every 3 days and I keep it on for about 30 minutes and then follow my routine with a sheet mask Its worked great for me My pores are not completely diminished but I definitely see a difference in my acne scarringspots in the days after I use the mask , i received this product as a gratis i wanted to try more from sephora collection since I havent really tried anything from the brand other than their brushes and lashes but when I first tried this OMG my face not only looked more illuminated but more hydrated and soft I seriously swear by this product i love this mask you just need to apply it for 10 minutes then rinse , I wanted to use the ordinary peel mask and drunk elephant baby mask when i saw this one offered My dry skin flakes up and I have bad blackheads that are raised throughout my nose and chin I use this once a week and my skin has gotten so much smoother Im in loveee , I struggle with acne around my chin and after using this for 2 weeks  it has definitely helped minimize the break outs and diminished the look of my acne scars  they are still

own based on my experience , My skin radiants like the sun after I apply the Resurfacing Peel Mask on My skin looks so juicy and beautiful , Sephora skincare is SO underrated This is an amazing

great made my skin feel so smooth and clean it was very gentle on my skin I am excited to continue using this peel , I love how light this mask feels on my skin Most of the peel mask feels heavy but not this one Also I have sensitive skin and allergic to fragrance so the fact that this product is vegan and is fragrance free makes my skin very happy Highly recommend trying it out , My skin is relatively sensitive and gets freaked out by BHAAHA The Resurfacing Peel Mask did not upset my skin although I recommend trying it on your hand first to be sure My hyperpigmentation did seem to be lightening after 23 uses , I love love this mask Ive been using it once a week and I am loving the results that it has on my skin My skin feels more glowy and radiant since Ive been using this mask , I am surprised at how much I enjoy using this I use this guy once a week at night to exfoliate and I feel so nice and smooth afterwards I have pretty oily skin so I exfoliate 2 times a week the second time with a leave on one Even my oily skin wouldnt be happy with this intensity more than once a week I dont think you should use this too frequently Its nice and cooling Overall I really enjoy this and would recommend giving it a try , I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review and have added this product to my current skin care routine due to the easiness of application and instant effective noticeable results after only one use on skin I would recommend this product to reduce dark spots as well as acne blemishes along with the disappearance of pores after 28 days of use The packaging is eco friendly made up of recycled sustainable material that is long lasting , I do use this twice a week and it has helped my skin a ton Im always really excited but also nervous to try or add to my skin care routine and I have done really well with this The texture is sort of a cold jelly feeling it goes on the skin super light and smooth almost feeling like its a moisturizer It does how ever dry up and you can feel it doing so After the 1015 min it comes off smoothly with water and a towel I started out using it once a week with nothing but my cleanser and moisturizer after to see how my face would react It has helped reduce my blemishes pores and has almost given a sort of refreshing radiant glow to my skin So far I have really loved my results and would definitely keep in my routine , This is such a great product to use for exfoliation It works to leave my skin feeling smoother and feeling fresh It has very high quality ingredients and is

this mask in your life Im a huge fan of any products that contain AHABHA but am sensitive to some so I was super excited to try this out to see how my skin would react I used this by itself at night and used nothing else in my routine other than my usual face wash and moisturizer so I could see if this actually made a difference I woke up and my skin was glowing I also saw a great improvement in overall tone and my pore size as well I would highlyyy recommend this to anyone  its an amazing product for the price , This mask has done SO MUCH for my pores Its so easy to use and you only leave it

that can change that is a plus in my book I do recommend moisturizing a good amount after every use , Sephora Collection gifted me to this product but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience This is so good I use it once a week and can notice a difference in my skin , Ive been using this mask for a few weeks now and have noticed a noticeable difference in my skin especially my forehead My forehead tends to get super dry in the colder months and this mask has help me balance that out , If you are looking for a nice resurfacing mask this might be it I am a fan of the Ordinary products and this Sephora Collection Resurfacing Peel Mask is up there with them The price point is great and it does the job However it is very DRYING on the skin as most resurfacing masks are so youll want an amazing moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated I only use this 12 months so keep that in mind , If you struggle with maskne like I did for a long time this product will be your holy grail skincare product that you will fall in love with This product helps to gently exfoliate the skin to help get rid of acne and leave you with brighter and smoother skin It also really helps with

moisturizer afterward , Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest opinion I love this product I was gifted it but cant wait to repurchase it It makes my skin feel so smooth and glow after using it , Great exfoliant  Helps minimize pores I recommend , I got this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review I have combination oily skin and decided to try this peel mask once a week I started to see some of my large pores reduce in size after the first 2 weeks I finally starting to use it 2x a week then noticed my dark spots and blemishes went down quicker than other products Ive used before Im truly impressed with the ingredients and texture of this product , I received this product from Sephora collection in exchange for my honest review The resurfacing peel mask is honestly pretty good for the price and Im really happy to find out that the ingredients are mostly clean I have large pores and after two weeks of using this consistently basically two times my face seems a bit smoother and tighter , This product refines smooths and moisturizes my skin like no other I cant live without it And the best part is it uses all natural ingredients that are enriching to my skin , I have to be honest I got this product for free for my review I am still going to be honest because I am very thorough in skincare and any product I put on my face I have gone through not only Western skincare products but also Asian skincare products and highend expensive brands to drugstore products Basically I like to think I know my stuff when it comes to skincareAlright now for the important aspects of this review Is it worth it In my opinion yes For the price point its very good and it does its job I have dry skin and it is hard to manage in the wintertime and I wanted to see how the peel mask would hold up Keep in mind that you should not be using this every day even if you do not have dry skin because improper use can damage your skin I recommend doing once a week first These are still chemicals youre putting on your face This product works phenomenally when you make sure youre moisturized well which you should be doing with any AHABHAPHA or chemical exfoliant anyway It gives me such a nice dewy look right after and if you make sure to routinely use it the longterm results are worth it Even my housemates knew I was different and we see each other every day Overall for the price point and results This is great I recommend this to anyone who would want to try a stronger chemical exfoliant but do not want to spend a lot of money for one on the offchance they dont like it I would start recommending this to my friends who want to try to get into skincare exfoliants as well , I was a little scared of this product at first but once I used it I was happy I did It was a perfect addition to my athome facial nights Leaves skin feeling soft and fresh , I love this  I love ahabha  because Ive got some dry skin  Winter makes

routine on repeat So far my skin is super soft and breakouts are clearing up Cant wait to see how well it minimizes my pores Worth buying and trying , Ive used it twice and the next day my face is sooo soft Im using it once a week usually on the weekend and it works great , Love the packaging and Cant wait to use this product for my dark spots , Perfect for an inexpensive athome spa day Definitely leaves skin looking more radiant it says after 28 days but literally you GLOW after the first use I also love the sustainable packaging Currently using it on my dark spots and Im happy to see improvement , I love the way this Sephora Collection mask makes my face feel You can definitely tell its working right after  my face feels smoother and cleaner , Id been looking for a mask that

Reusable 3-Piece Grey Face Mask Set,"I love it everyday someone ask me for this  mask the color are very fashionable and also they are thick for better protection , I absolutely love these masks Ive never received so many compliments before , Cute but bulky  hot The layer close to your skin scrunches up and is annoying , Loveee these masks Theyre comfortable and easy to breathe in They wash well in the machine Ive been receiving compliments every time Im out wearing this mask Only negative I can say is that I wish there was an opening in the mask for the silicone to go inside Another reviewer mentioned that she wishes they came with a black background I wish that too Please read these reviews and make the masks in black , Cutest masks ever They really do make other people happy never got as many reactions to a mask before My daughter is an elementary school teacher and her colleagues and students went crazy over it 3 , So fun Got so many compliments wish it came in black background , Cute online seems like a good idea  but kind of creepy looking when worn like Michel Myers creepy looking , The masks are cute but thats about it The embroidered lips are right in the middle which kind of squishes against your lips or presses the silicone guard against your face Its not the most comfortable with or without the face guard There is a nose wire in it which can be bent to conform more to the face and the elastic is adjustable making it comfortable around the ears , I think its the cutest thing ever Love wearing it to work I keep the red lips in my purse as a backup Even with restrictions coming down sometimes its nice to wear one I especially like to wear a mask when allergies are kicking my butt The silicone shield does take some getting use to Its pretty small but comfortable to use I washed it with the rest of my clothes and it came out looking great Cant say the same for many of my other masks , I got these not expecting them to match my African American skin tone They are grey not the color of anyones skin  that Ive ever seen at least They are super cute and I always get compliments on them Plus the little shield included that keeps the mask off your lip gloss is pretty awesome , Love these masks They are excellent quality and look cute on as far as wearing a mask that covers up half your face is concerned The first time I wore one someone complimented me on it , I have a petite face  these fit me well I dont have the skin color of these masks which I wasnt trying to match  it still looks nice These are fun and at the same time I did purchase these with rewards funds so I got them basically for free I am happy with this purchase , This is a cute idea for a face mask but the masks smelled of the plastic it comes in The masks are more child size than adult Returning and would not recommend"
Reusable Cotton Pads,"These are great I do have to replace them about twice a year but it saves a lot of waste money and is softer on my skin than disposable ones , This is exactly what I wanted It has one soft side and one slightly rougher side for exfoliation , Cotton is too porous a material to remove makeup anything will stain it I actually use another reusable product thats made of a different material to remove my makeup But for applying toner these pads are the perfect softness and level of absorbancy and they come out of the wash completely clean , They stain horribly lose their shape after one wash and just look gross after one use I mean who wants to clean their eyes a second time with something that looks dirty No thank you Cant seem to find the receipt Otherwise I would certainly be returning these Huge waste of money do not buy , Really love that these are eco friendly and washable , super easy to use and easy to wash makes taking of my makeup so much quicker , these are fine but they break pretty easily i dont use them often and two have ripped apart when cleaning them , very soft and easy to use I m impatient to put them in the washer and see  , These are ok They wash well but when using the coton side it sort of peels on my face but or else great and effective way to waste less , These work well for a time but after the second washdry and I dried them on gentle they start to warp really badly Now I use them to wash my face so I still get use out of them but they fabric just didnt hold up for being washed and dried , These are a great alternative to disposable tissue my only question is how long will they last Ive had these for 7 months use one or two a week and wash them with mild makeup brush soap Each wash they get fuzzier and fuzzier like the cotton is breaking down BUTfor being 7months old and just now showing signs of breakdown Ill say these are a great option , These are soft and absorbent and wash up really nice , Good starting off but then they stained so quickly made my skin break out no other changes in my routine didnt fully clean my face like disposable ones did and generally just irritated my skin Saddd because I love ecofriendly solutions to waste but these are just not it Dont waste your money , These work really well Wish they would put more cotton pads in the box found it to be expensive for the quantity that you get , Kind of confused by all the bad reviews While I agree that when you wash these they then do not lay flat and the edges become mishapen but that does not change the effectiveness of these pads One side is soft and one side is rougher almost like an exfoliation which is a nice option I just throw these in the laundry with everything else and they clean great Awesome for taking off makeup especially under the eye I just use my micellar water swipe and Im good to go to cleanse , I recently got 2 bamboo reusable rounds and loved how they felt and removed makeup well They were a bit pricey so I was hoping to find something of reasonably similar quality at a lower price Not so much These dont feel as nice they stain more easily and get misshapen after washing I dont hate em just wish Id sucked it up and gotten more of the better quality ones , This sucks as sometimes looking for an eco friendly alternative this sucked so much Washing it by hand felt like I was a raccoon washing cotton candy This literally came apart after one use Plus it has a very raspy feel to it not gentle enough , Ive mostly used these reusable pads for toner and theyve been great I dont have much experience using these to remove makeup other than mascara but havent had any issues with the mascara staining so farMy only complaint is that the bag doesnt stay closed in the washing machine so I tie it , really hard to wash by hand cotton pads easily fall out of bag when in the washer mascara and eyeliner stain the cotton pads leaving a grayblack residue after each use easier to just double cleanse , If you are someone who removes their makeup with Micellar water these reusable pads are for you Way more practical than the single use pads you toss away They wash up nicely and are very soft and gentle on the skin A little pricey for only getting 7 in the pack but more cost effective in the loss run than the disposal pads , These work great and are exactly as I expected Makeup can stain them but Ive had good luck removing a lot of it by handwashing with castile soap from time to time and machine washing for more routine cleaning , Theyre nice but the color of makeup doesnt go away They deform after wash I bought some bamboo cotton pads online and am very happy with those Their price are lower too , Quality deteriorated after the first wash I only use with a toner to wipe my face no heavy makeup Would not recommend Ive gotten better off etsy , Only used for light toner and every single one completely falls apart Whether you use either side I bought new ones from another brand at a local zero waste store and theyre much better Im not sure why sephora failed so hard at these def bummer since I normally love Do not waste your money , The size of the cotton pads are a bit bigger than normal ones so I tilt my head forward when using them since it kinda folds around my fingers But still a great product overall Ive washed mine twice now with no damage to any of them , Really like what these do for the environment I just throw them in the wash after use as they dont take up any room They absorb a lot , Not worth the money The soft side got all torn up after first wash No amount of soap is cleaning out the makeup I used urban decay makeup remover to wipe the makeup clean This is disappointing Going in the trash unfortunately , I bought these to pair with my Sephora BrandTriple Action Cleansing Water  Cleanse  PurifyThe fact that they have a soft side and an exfoliating side is amazing although I really only have had to use the soft side The pads are pretty big not quite sure how they compare to others but its more than enough to remove all of my makeupI fully intend on getting another set mostly because I only do a load of laundry maybe every two weeks , Not sure why I havent thought of buying this earlier but these are amazing 100 would recommend these cotton pads they are 100 reusable and the baggie is great for not loosing them in the wash They work even better than the disposable ones and come out like new every time , These are a great way to reduce consumption of traditional cotton pads So far these have done a great job Theyre about 75 larger than most cotton pads so you get more surface area I use different areas of each pad for make up remover micro water and then toner I go through a pad a day so at the end of the week I throw it in the mesh bag launder it and then start anew My pads do have some permanent stains from eye makeup removal but they are laundered so its more of a superficial thing Definitely wash the pads before your first use Im so glad I got these after a few weeks Ive saved money and so long as these continue to perform as well as they do I dont see myself going back to traditional disposable cotton pads , good quality  i try not to buy from amzon so this was the best price i could find i wash them in the washer in the bag and clip them up to dry and they have held up really well theyre not too rough but i just use them for miscellar water they may be too rough for your face with exfoliants , Ive used WAY more make up pads than I care to admit these dont ever come back perfectly white but who cares  They could be a little softer I avoid on days when my skin feels sensitive but still worthwhile , I bought them for wiping off makeup and 1st cleanser balm  I wet the pads with water then start wiping  It does the job that the normal disposal cotton pads used to do for me  Although these are reusable the stain never comes off even after handwashing right away with Dawn soap or putting it in the wash  I washed them all before I started using by placing them in the bag and knotting it so they dont come out of it  That worked like a charm  One pad also opened in the seam like one of the reviewers said  If you dont mind dirty looking pads all the time then you might like these  If youre only using it to apply toner these will work great  The longevity of these will not be long if you wash them a lot  If they become too nasty looking I will toss them and go back to disposable cotton pads , I like these a lot They are larger than a usual cotton round pad from the drugstore One side is super soft and the other side is a little more textured I have two sets one to remove my eye make up and one to apply my toner with I keep the sets separate which is easy to do since they have the little laundry bag Great if you want to reduce waste in your routine , Definitely want to but more of these I absolutely love using these now I typically would buy just one use cotton pads from Target but I will be purchasing more of these for sure , Started to fall apart after the first wash I use a lot of different reusable cotton pads and none have pulled up and degraded like these ones do I never got a chance to use them as I washed them before my first use , Im really surprised by these mixed reviews I decided to give these a chance during the sale and Im glad I did I threw them in the wash and dryer in their provided bag prior to first use and though they curled up I laid them flat just using my fingers and theyre back to new I also use them primarily with eye makeup remover and they work great no fluffs of cotton coming off It might be a quality control problem in this case because mine are everything I wanted from this product , I love the idea of reusable cotton rounds so I picked these up during the sale I got a round wet with remover and used the soft side of it to take off eye makeup cotton came off of it into my eye I dont recommend using the soft side of it near your eyes and they seem to be falling apart just after one use disappointed and going back to disposables from walmart , Better than not reusable cotton pads I use it with micellar water and my skin looks fresh and better when I use this pads , I love the two different sides one for more exfoliation and one that is soft There are 7 pads in the set so you can use one each day of the week and then throw all of them in the bag in the wash 1010 recommend for the folks who are looking to be more ecoconscious with their skincare and makeup collection , Very useful but hard to launder They tend to curl after washing which is a bit annoying but overall satisfied , These hold up great Ive had them for several months now They wash easy they remove makeup with ease and they hold product without holding it too well so I dont get any on my face I thought I would have issues with the nontextured side pilling but its holding up great These are fantastic for anyone wanting to reduce waste And you cant beat the price , I thought it works for cleaning mascara but only works for regular make up and nothing on the eyes if you need to clean only make up around your face then this product is fine for you otherwise I wouldnt recommend  this product , Jadore ce produit coresponsable et parfait pour appliquer mon tonique  Jai la peau sensible donc jutilise toujours le ct le plus doux Je les laves dans la petite pochettes et les schent ensuite  lair libre , Nothing to complain about Everyone needs items like this that reduce our environmental impact I love that theyre doublesidedThey get stained but I dont think thats a huge concern , Adorable eco friendly wallet friendly soft cute perfect love them , First wash already come apart at the edges I wash them in the laundry bag , super convenient and great quality i use these everyday to remove makeup and have yet to find something negative about them SO GOOD , These are okay but after one washing a couple of them came apart at the edges Also dont like that stains are difficult to get out If you can ignore the dirty look they work and still save buying disposable ones , These are 1010 everything I want them to be and more My only small gripe is that the bag doesnt stay closed in the wash , These are a  saver Theyre very soft on the face U do have to wash them in order to get the cotton round soaked with the liquid ur using I noticed before I washed them  applied a liquid on them the liquid would just sit on top of the cotton  spill over But after I washed them thats no longer an issue Theyre still very soft after I washdry them Great material , These are good quality and at a decent price Save me a lot of money from buying packs of disposable cotton pads The only thing is that the bag doesnt stay tied so the contents kept flying out of the bag during machine wash , These are so much better than regular cotton pads They wash with your regular laundry theyre super adorable and you only have to buy them once I bought two sets to use for my morning and night toner and only have to wash them once a week , These are a product revolution  Fanstastic  Larger sized pads of robust construction  One side is slightly textured for light exfoliation and the other is very soft brushed cotton  I use it with my toner or micellar water  They have thoughtfully included 7 pads so you can put them all in the washer once a week What a fantastic idea to discourage waste and promote the idea of recyclingrenewal  A fantastic value and doing our part to help , Great for removing makeup love that they are reusable and love the washing bag , I love using these for cleansing They wash dry really well , So now I see the hype and why these are nearly always sold out theyre awesome The cotton pads are a nice size see photos and hold the products I use well I dont remove makeup with them though I use them for my toners When I received them I washed them immediately with warm water on a gentle cycle in my washing machine The pads came out of the little cotton bag that they came with but I had put them in yet another laundry bag just in case so no biggieI let them air dry for around 78 hours and just used them for the first time Theyre great Im hoping Ill save  using these by not having to purchase cotton pads over and overI hope this review helps someone"
Rose Quartz Facial Roller,"I really liked this product until it broke I have had it for about a year and I use it before dates auditions shoots ect Today when I took it out of its little bag the main roller was completely detached and a small plastic piece was was in the bag I needed to depuff my face so I went to use the smaller side and it made a squeaky noise and immediately fell off the holder I think the materials are nice but the assembly of the product ruins it , This product helped lift my face and felt really nice it did make a little bit of a squeaky sound but otherwise i love it , I really loved using this for my face It was especially helpful as a way to relax my jaw muscles after a stressful day Id put it in my fridgefreezer in a container and then use it with some moisturizer for a nice cold rolling effect Amazing especially during our hot summersUnfortunately it didnt last long as it snapped right in half about 2 weeks after I started using it Very disappointed I didnt bother trying to return or exchange it since its such a hassle and I got it on sale I would replace it after the snapping but twenty bucks is just too expensive for an item that isnt made to really last through regular use , it was great until it broke it broke really easily , After reading some reviews I decided to write my own how does it break for some people after 23 uses when mine has been great for way over a year I bought this in 2020 and its still holding strong , I have thought about getting one of these for a while  I love it  When you use it the stone is cold and it feels great  It really does help the serum sink into the sink better  Plus its pretty and also comes with a pink pouch , I love that this roller doesnt squeak Comes with a pouch which is a bonus but Ill still keep it in the packaging it came in for precaution , way too fragile plus the metal had a tendency to squeak , After putting on serum product and moisturizer I use it every morning and day and night daily , I got this on sale but it still wasnt worth my money it broke apart after the second use the metal pieces are just not strong enough specifically on the side for the big roller which is the one I need the mostIt looks exactly like everyone elses pictures that broke off will look for a different brand because I know it will just break again if I get the same one , Great facial roller at a fraction of the cost of others on the market , Didnt realize how much I needed this product until I tried it Feels cool and refreshing after applying moisturizer Love it , I just got it its super squeaky I might return it , I keep this in the fridge and use it with my daily and nightly routines Definitely a must have in anyones arsenal , Had this for a while always cold to the touch use it just for facial message or some times to put the sun block on , I just got my rose quarts roller a couple of days ago  I use morning  night I have noticed that my skin is firmer  tighter looking I really love this roller  I like that it comes with a travel bag to store it in Must have tool , Im half and half in this one I like it I put it in my skincare fridge I think that it depuffs nicely However i have had other rollers much better quality that I would recommend over this So if you dont want to spend a crap ton of money its great Especially if its your first one but if you want to spend  then find another roller , Well I hope I dont jinx myself but I must have lucked out with a roller that did NOT squeak leave black streaks or thus far break I was told by my esthetician not to spend more than 20 on one of these I loved the appearance of this one and so far its been great I love using it which has practically been every day since Ive had it , I wish I could give this 0 starsafter three uses it looked like the image I uploaded Honestly such a waste of money , Horrible  Bad quality  Large quartz fell after first use  Dont waste your money , Helps so much with defuffing and cooling down redness Put it in the fridge for that extra Ahhh Ive use this roller when I have a serum or sheet mask on too The SEPHORA roller is great value its a good quality for a luxurious experience , overall it works well ive notice a face changed compared to a few months back one concern is that is very loud when it rolls , Seriously amazing I keep mine in my skin care fridge so Im the morning I can use it and it helps with redness and depuffing , Super awesome product that I highly recommend  I had a lypoma on my forehead and from using this product it has been reabsorbed by my body  No more bump , it works fine tbh just like any other jade roller but was so expensive i really shouldve searched more cus i found a lot cheaper ones elsewhere bht doesnt matter it looks cute af , Love this super cooling roller Its a great way to wake up my face in the morning and relax at night Especially helpful for tension headaches , Metal is rusted When I roll the rose quartz over my face it leaves a black residue on my face I clean it after every use but it doesnt help Super squeaky Not worth 20 , It works really well until it breaks Ive gotten two of these so far and both of them have broken within a few months of use After a while mine started to leave my face with black marks and flakes or something on it Before it broke it was very helpful at helping my products absorb and it felt very nice Sadly it broke , Solidly built feels lovely after storing in fridge  Use it every day  Great quality product at an excellent price , I love that I got the rose quartz one  Honestly it doesnt do anything in terms of getting rid of acne or getting rid of scarring but personally I find it relaxing and nice when I roll it on my face after my serum Bonus when I keep it in the fridge and the coldcool feeling feels so nice It does reduce redness and slight inflammations especially in the mornings , This is just okay nothing special It does make a squeaking sound but its not terrible I mainly use it to rub in my serums and it works well for this purpose , I quite like this tool I dont think it really does anything but its very relaxing and enjoyable to use I like that there is a larger and a smaller end My only complaint is that it can get really squeaky , this is the worst i bought one for my friend  i and i regret it its super squeaky it has gotten a little better with use but it is not worth it , This is very good quality It squeaks a little but for the price point Id say its worth it Im planning to get more in different colours It warms up pretty quickly as you roll over your faceneck so have to be quick about it But then the stone cools down before next use , I love this roller I like to use it at night to help me de stress and relax Its the perfect size I also have a more expensive one and I always reach for this one more often Many reviews say it squeaks but I dont notice it all , The cool quartz does feel nice on my face but this thing squeaks like crazy which detracts from its use as a relaxation tool and also calls into question its over all quality Its not the most expensive but I still expect it to hold up and Im not confident it will , It does the job but boy is it squeaky Love how cool it stays without having to put it in the fridge , Love it Feels so nice and cool on my face The squeaking is there but its not nearly as bad as people are describing it as Comes in a cute package as well Definitely worth the price , Its ok Im not using it long enough to tell whether or not its doing anything positive , I had high hopes for this roller but its so poorly made I used it for the second time today and found that the small roller stopped rolling after one use Youre supposed to use the small roller extremely gently under your eyes so you dont drag the skin but because the roller doesnt roll anymore its useless Im returning this immediately and ordering the jade gua sha tool instead which is supposed to be better for facial sculpting anyway Dont waste your money on this crappy roller , Its pretty looking but makes noise and the gold is coming off which makes the tool smell like metal Other than that it massages the face pretty good , This roller is beautiful so at first I was wondering why its so much less expensive than the higher end ones And then I used it It doesnt glide smoothly and it makes a horrible squeaking noise the entire time It sounds like a rusty old bicycle squeaking every time it rolls I had to return it after just one use Definitely worth investing in a higher end version if you want the full relaxing roller experience , Loved it at first but it Broke after two uses The larger roller broke and snapped off , I absolutely love this product I love how it stays cools and I also love how it feels on my face I will be recommending this Facial Roller to my family and friends , I loved how it felt and how it came with a bag and it seemed like it was great quality until not even a week later it broke and I had not dropped it or anything The smaller roller came off when I went to pick it up I was not happy I spent 20 for something that would soon break , This product is amazing i love how it stays cool and it doesnt squeak at all for me i definitely recoment this product , I was extremely skeptical about this facial roller just Bc I didnt see a lot of reviews Honestly when i first picked it up I was extremely surprised at the weight and how good and cold the Rose quartz was against my skin and the gliding was so effortless even my boyfriend loved it  , Love the look and packaging with the a pouch to hold the roller Only problem is that mine is a bit squeaky Personally it doesnt take away from the relaxation but other than that it rolls really well , This is a good quality roller for the price but like others mentioned it does squeak when its rolling Not a huge deal but kind of annoying and knocks it down a star , The metal turned black around the roller part Ive used it just 3 times Not a great product , Love how it stays cool Just what I was looking for , Going to return this it wont stop squeaking its really annoying when youre trying to relax and realize its loose kinda understand the price difference Going to try the non Sephora product hope that one doesnt make any noises , The packaging is so cute and it comes with a nice bag but then you use it and realize how terrible the quality is Its loose and feels like its about to break and it squeaks like crazy Definitely returning , Its decent facial roller for 20 bucks Feels cool and stays cool for a while Helps depuff eyes a bit Its nothing you need but its fun to play around with Deducting a star because squeak squeak squeak on the large end of the roller Its annoying lol , I put mine in the freezer and 4 nights a week as part of my bed time routine run it all over my face Not sure of actual results but it feels wonderful and is non invasive , Feels very relaxing and I have noticed my face to be much tighter , I love it and it is currently my favorite nice and fair price love the pouch so much Yay I do recommend it , This is my first face roller i had a pleasant experience using it along with skincare after putting the roller in the freezer highly recommend that for people suffering from eczemarednesscontact dermatitis swelling my only complaint is that it sometimes squeaks even when i tried to oil it , Love it for using apart of my bedtimePM skincare routine Havent tried putting it in the fridge yet but love it as is , This product was truly beautiful in person unfortunately it came with rusty spots in various areas where the metal part touched the rose quartz I cant imagine what sort of damaging effects some rust can have on the face So unfortunate because this was a really pretty piece , This is always cool to the touch Has amazing calming effect on me Hell my eyes to look less puffy and is great on the cheeks and neck , Feels nice and cool on my skin while it perfectly works all of my products deeper into my skin It feels very therapeutic and also helps me open up my sinuses a little bit Only complaint is that the smaller side does stick and squeak a little bit , I love my new jade roller It feels so good on my face after a long day I dont always put mine in the fridge and it still feels good I highly recommend , I love this  roller I immediately saw a difference and it feels awesome on my skin Great to use with all my Glow recipe products , Love my roller I blend my creams n oils in with this and i love it , I love this roller Inexpensive Stays cool Refreshing in the morning after I apply moisturizer It did squeak at first I see a lot of complaints about that a little face oil on the metal bar between the roller takes care of that , it squeaks and makes annoying noise while using it Ive only used this a couple of times and its already broken Both the bigger and smaller pieces have fallen off ive tried to put them back on but they continue to fall , This is my first time trying a roller so I bought this one since i didnt want to spend so much on something I was trying for the first time I was not disappointed and now see what the hype is about I use it before bed with a rose oil and my face looks sooo soft in the morning The rollers got a little squeaky but thats not really a huge deal for me , Enjoying the benefits however this roller is squeaky like an old cart  If you dont mind that then go for it , Great quality been using for over a year now and it works well , This little roller is fantastic I keep it in a drawer and in its bag so its always clean and cool to the touch when I use it I love using this at night after washing moisturizing and then spritzing my face with a hydrating spray or in the morning after washing and putting my moisturizer on Dont forget the neck too friendsI personally feel like some of the usual swelling I see under my eyes has gone down after using this daily for about two weeks and I agree with another users comments  it feels extra nice if put in the fridge for a few minutes for an extra burst of cool on the face , is one of my favs facial rollers with a good moisturizer leave my skin so soft , This rollar is a high quality option if you need one of these but dont want to spend 45 However it NEEDS so be refrigerated or put in the freezer Other wise it is useless , It feels very nice and does the job BUT it squeaks really bad when rolling and sometimes it doesnt even roll Definitely not the best quality , Loving it The cool stone feels very nice on my skin and it almost feels like it waking it up when I use , While I love this product and what it does very cooling and great for the skin it is not very good quality My dog ran into my vanity and knocked the roller off and onto the carpeted floor while still in the bag and it totally split in half I still recommend this product but I feel like you might be able to find a cheaper one for the same quality this one is my pervious roller from Walmart had the same effect as this one but was much cheaper Although this roller did roll much better and felt a little bit more legit so I will say that it isnt the worst buying choice Ive made I still use this roller even though its split in half , very nice I put a little water on both ends and roll on my face for a nice cooling sensation because i dont have a skincare fridge , I received this as a gift for Christmas and at first I was so excited It was soooo cooling and evenly distributed my facial oil However somewhere between the 5th 10th use the large roller fell off of the the rest of it Im going to try and super glue it back on but pretty disappointed with the quality , My new favorite addition to my morning routine  Its really calming and relaxing to do I put it in the fridge for a cooling sensation , This roller feels very nice and cooling on the skin other than the intense squeaking sound coming from it every time I roll it on my face Do not recommend , Okay yeah This squeaks as you roll it onto your face but honestly Ive bought and returned a handful of face rollers on amazon and this beats their quality The cheaper ones on amazon squeak also but most have scratches and are dull This is a bit more pricey than the ones on amazon but is a little bit more higher quality Honestly it would be much better to buy a pricier one if the squeak bothers you that much Im settling for this one , Great roller for a reasonable price I love the dual sides for getting into smaller areas and bigger areas The stones roll easily across my face and are great for helping serum absorb and depuffing Its very easy to clean and seems fairly sturdy , I absolutely love this facial massager because I can feel the different immediately when I start using I also really like that it stays cold feels very refreshing , I add this facial massager in my skincare routine and it is so relaxing love it , Ive never had one of those expensive jade rollers or anything but it does feel really nice and its cheaper I dont see why it wouldnt do the same thing I gave it as a gift to my mom and she loves it She uses it every night , It works great and feels really nice but it broke within an hour of buying it Its mostly my fault though I dropped it and it hit mu dresser but it landed on carpet so I thought it was fine Im still going to use it I just wish it was more durable , It squeaks a LOT but I really like face rolling For the price its okay , Just purchased this today and I love it I noticed results immediately I only gave it four stars bc it squeaks when you roll onto your face but other than that it would get five stars Cuz price is also perfect , I just bought this and the squeaking of the rolling is not relaxing at all Sounds like an old rusty swing at a playground Will return , This definitely helps reduce puffiness I keep mine in the fridge and use it every morning as part of my morning time skin regimen , I wanted to like it but just like the other review that i read the bigger side of stone was detached from the handle before i even use it Im going to return it and will purchase a different brand , My daughter wanted this for so long  We finally bought one and she was super excited about using it  Its nice and smooth on the skin but it makes a terrible squeaking noise when you roll it that makes it not fun to use  However we threw away the packaging so we cant return it , Buy one before it sells out again Its a great additional to your night time winding down skincare ritual I use it to massage my serum in and its FABULOUS Sephora come out with more products like this , Broke immediately You can find a better priced   quality facial massager else where Dont do it to yourself , I use this to put on my moisturizer at night I can tell that my skin has gotten less puffier under my eyes I also put it in the fridge for a soothing feel , Love love love this tool I didnt know I needed it until I took a chance and bought myself one , Adore it Cooling relaxing and refreshing I am hooked I use it with Herbivore Rose Hibiscus Spray , I really like the facial massager Not only does it massage your face the cold feeling feels amazing as well , I use it with my rose water mist and face serums but Ive had to take things into my own hands after it broke The roller stays in the bag when Im not using it and it stays safe in my little fridge so I was confused to see it was already broken After some industrial glue it works like new and I use it all the time , Wonderful makes my skin feel great in the morning , Bought this a few months ago JanuaryFebruary and was at first very into this product Unfortunately its already broken The bigger crystal completely fell off Really disappointed that Sephora is not creating a more lasting quality product , Not sure how it is going to help just yet only felt good when i used it cool to skin and easy to use but for the result it will take times to know , If you see this just grab it and thank me later I use this to apply all moisturizers and creams onto my face It helps to apply a seamless application while working the product into the skin , Awful loved it the first days then no matter how much you clean it it rusts which gets on your face Then the wheel came off all together Terrible Trying to return  Just a Few small changes would make this product incredible , I purchased one for a gift and one for myselflike many others within minutes of using the top roller fell out Before I wrote it off completely I opened the other and while that one did not fall apart it squeaked from dust accumulating on the metal I hope Sephora redesigns it and sells an updated version , I added this to my skincare routine I love it I can tell a difference when I use it wmoisturizer Face feels soft and a little bit of a glow , Love this Used it when a migraine headache was coming on Helped simmer it down , This roller makes my skin feel so good I store it in my refrigerator for a cooling effect when I use it on my skin , Used it 3 times and then the smaller roller stopped rolling Id recommend splurging on a more expensive one as it does feel nice , After applying a facial oil using this right after a shower closes my pores and helps trap the moisture in my skin I love the dual ends for easy use My skin stays glowing , Love Use every night to massage my oil and moisturizer in , I love the cooling feeling of this roller It is obviously super cute and a great addition by Sephora collection at a reasonable price Would love to see more Rose Quartz  crystal related facial products by SC as the quality of this one was not extraordinary I do wish it didnt squeak On the small side although it is primarily used for the larger stone  I do agree with some other reviews I did notice a black residue where the hole of the quartz meets the metal Overall however The product and packaging is beautiful and the product worked well for me I recommend if youre looking for an application with oils and the end of your routine with moisturizer Would get another for a gift and seems reasonable to travel with , Great price Wanted to love it I purchased one and I even bought my sister one It fell apart on the second day one of the metal things were loose And the black stuff on the sides of the rollers all of them are like that I inspected all the Sephora rollers and all of them had this black stuff on the sides I even tried cleaning it with a qtip and still couldnt get it all out I will be exchanging it for another Sephora roller and well see what happens , I do not believe in the powers of a stone I just bought this because I barely sleep sometimes and I always just wanted something cold to put on my eyes and massage my face with every morning This does just that there really isnt much more to say The big stone side does squeak a little depends on the pressure I put The small stone does not squeak at all ever You do have to be careful when you pass the roller near your eyelashes because I was rolling the smaller side very near my lower lashes and they got stuck in the small hole where the metal goes through the stone So from now on I just close my eyes and pass the big stone all over my eyes and under eyes which is how I was supposed to be doing it to begin with , Great tool to help massage in moisturizers and to use over sheet masks Its cool to the touch without being put in the refrigeratorI Use it a night as a relaxing way to unwind from my day , This is a great roller that helped my skin absorb my moisturizer when it would normally become dry I bought this four days ago and returned it today When I brought it home to use the bottom smaller roller fell off but I was able to put it back on which would eventually fall off again Then rolling the smaller part of the rose quartz the metal which is inserted into the rose quartz only about 18 and theres space so its not tight if that makes sense clips your lashes and the rose quartz against the metal causes friction so theres black dust on the inside of the holes where the metal is supposed to be inserted but the rose quartz ended up falling out The smaller rose quartz could wiggle its way out when its used for rolling Besides the manufacturing error this roller happens to be very nice and definitely helps the skin look depuffed and products absorb better I had no problems with the larger roller If youre able to clamp or tighten the metal inside the smaller rose quartz your problems with this roller would be solved and Id suggest this Otherwise dont buy this , I picked it up from the package and the little roller side fell off So its uhnot the best quality Returning , Helped with my under eye puffiness Im a few days from 40 and suddenly within the last few weeks whatever side I roll on in my sleep I wake to that eye puffy Ive been using this in the mornings when I apply my eye cream and it helped the swelling , Love it Good quality for a better price I am very happy with this and so glad I was able to pick up the last one in the store last week Theyre adorable , It is very pretty And I love the pink dust bag it comes with for storage But it is very poorly made and the medal feels very cheap Iv had it for about 5 minutes and I can hear and feel the roller hit the medal and creating the medal into dust and its collecting the dust making it black , Okay so this was definitely a splurge its not something I absolutely needed in my skincare routine but it actually has been working really well It definitely helps my skin absorb serums and eye creams its refreshing and cooling on my skin and it gives me a glowy look dont know how but my skin just looks dewy and plump after I use the roller Theres just one thing it squeaks I have yet to put oil on it to try and remove the squeak and I will but Ive only used it a couple times and its already squeaking  storage pouch is really cute and easy to use Overall its a good product if you want to enhance your skin care routine a little , Built up a black gunk in the roller after a week I never used any product with it nor got it wet I loved the roller and it seemed like a high quality quartz I went to exchange it at the Sephora store bought it online but when I looked at the other new ones they had the same black stuff in the roller It smelled like old cheap metal rubbing together or like old pennies I was really disappointed to say the least Buyer beware , this is amazing it works just as good as any other one but costs half the price it helped sooth my skin and is over all amazing , Love this product i can already see a difference within a few days my skin has become so much smoother and glowing since it massage the products i use into my skin and helps blood circulation I would Definitely recommend , I was able to find one in a local Sephora store and of course I had to try it out right away It felt really good on my skin especially after I put eye and face oil on my skin I havent seen any effects yet but it made me feel good so I give it 5 stars , I had wanted to try a facial roller but really didnt want to shell out close to 100 Im so happy I found this Great value and has now become a part of my nightly routine , For 25 this is perfect Its NOT worth spending 50100 on the ridiculously expensive versions of the SAME THING This does the trick is nice and cooling and is great quality Highly recommend , The cooling effect from the stone is really nice and calming however I do place it in the fridge as the cool stone goes warm after rolling it over my face for a minute I rolled with coconut oil and it did absorb so well but worked well with my vitamin C serum Would I recommend well other than the calming and cooling effect which feels nice Im not sure what else it is doing but I guess with continued use over the years maybe its benefits will be more visible Definitely happy I spent 25 for it opposed to the more expensive ones which by the way feel the same as the Sephora brand its a cute addition to my skin care regime as I usually opt for more natural skin care techniques , Really recommend great product I love applying my facial oil at night and massaging it into the skin with this facial massager super soothing , I love using this Its super relaxing and seems to help depuff my face in the morning , Really wanted to love this because it is a great price but I am a little disappointed because within 2 minutes of opening and using the facial massager the small roller completely fell off and wont stay on when i try to put it back on guess it was poorly made , Definitely worth investing inthis tool stays cool and provides a calm and pampering way to end the night Ive used this with both serums and facial oils and it helps the absorption while creating a relaxing massage I just rinse clean and roll dry on a tissue after , I got this as a Christmas present and I love it so much It feels so nice and its just relaxing , it is so soothing and it feels really nice it is cold so it relaxes the face a lot , I just purchased this less than a week ago and I absolutely love it  not sure why wanted so long to invest in one of these  I use it morning and evening I leave in the freezer before using it  highly recommended doing it that  Ive been applying a serum on my face before using the roller but Im sure a moisture etc is fine as well I roll for about 35 mins to let the serum penetrate better into the skin  Definitely add this to your skin care regimen"
Rose Quartz Gua Sha,"I barely even dropped this and it shattered and broke Its very fragile dont waste your money Im very upset because I wanted to love this , Im a beginner with using a gua sha and so I decided to buy this one and try it out After 3 uses Ive enjoyed it but it slipped out of my hand and fell into the sink from a 2 inch drop and broke Its super fragile and delicate I do recommend this as your first gua sha since it does the job but I suggest buying a higher quality gua sha , After using this in my skin care for the past couple of weeks now I see a more defined shape in my jawline I definitely recommend this product it helped so much , Ive always purchased gua shas from Sephora and this one is extremely thin small  low quality Hopefully theyll bring back the better quality ones , Ive been using this product for 3 days both morning and night and am in love I already see more definition in my jawline I recommend pressing lightly I think I may have slightly bruised my cheekbone after the first use due to pressing so hard lol , Used once enjoyed it Then it slid off the sink edge into the sink and broke a 3 inch drop So definitely fragile I realise its a starter one and not expensive but not sure this should have happened , It feels very good on the skin and the size is perfect Also it looks very pretty in person , The first one I ordered came chipped I got in touch with Sephora and they sent another one however it came chipped as well I think there is quality issues I have another Sephora brand Gua sha and its fine Must just be this one in particular"
SUPERMASK - The Charcoal Mask,"The Good I got this significantly discounted to the point of it costing a few bucks I want to say thats good but thats still expensive for one sheet mask especially when it doesnt work well I truly have very little good things to say about this mask but before I jump into the bad part of this review the meat and potatoes I want to point out by saying I have gotten numerous different Sephora Collection masks and 8090 of them I actually really end up enjoying which I think gives me a good comparison of the qualityexpectations of this brand when it comes to their sheet masksThe Bad I have oily skin especially in the summer and can sometimes still spring up some random breakouts even in my mid 20s so when I saw this charcoal mask I was extremely excited Charcoal usually works good on my face and Ive had success with some acneaimed sheet masks from SC The overall fit of this felt just off laying on my face and it was significantly drier than what I expect from my usual SC masks which are usually very saturated with serums I also didnt feel any pore tightening and minimizing effect from this mask I truly did not see any results both long or short term Lastly this mask somehow left my skin feeling dry which is a really strange experience and result from a sheet mask which is usually hydrating regardless of if its aimed at targeting acne or pore minimization The UglyHonest Even at its hugely discounted price this mask is still not worth it in my opinion There are better cheaper and more effective masks out there even within the SC collection This mask is a total miss in comparison to their usual quality I was highly disappointed , the mask didnt fit great my nose was completely left out of it so I had to rub the product on my nose  it said to leave it on for 15 mins and no need to rinse just rub the product in so I did and my face is super sticky hours later , I love Sephoras masks and the promos where you can purchase three and get one for free The charcoal is the one I always have on hand I make my husband use one once a week I alternate between the charcoal mud mask and recently discovered bubble mask You see immediate results And if youre religious about it your skin will look more youthful , Great for prepping skin prior to applying makeup Give my skin a glowing and smooth finish It is miserable applying though because theres a lot of liquid and its cold But no other complaints , Meh This product does nothing honestly First of all it doesnt fit the face properly Its all wet and sticky and it doesnt necessarily get rid of impurities , Meh This did nothing great for me I would recommend the innisfree super volvanic clay mask instead That one works , this mask is soooo good it cleans and refreshs i thought its gonna be a waste of money but it is worth it you just need to use it with a deep cleansing mask , I did not like this mask It was extremely wet like dripping down under my chin The urea smell definitely came through along with a lot of fragrance I could not keep it on the entire 25 minutes and had to remove and wash my face It was uncomfortable , I though this mask worked really well My face felt very soft after I used it Personally I dont think it should be 6 4 or 5 would be more realistic , It was great experience to use this mask It helps to evens my skin removing all the dirt and minimizing my pores , Did what it said it would do Dried out the oil and minimized a breakout I saw starting to happen Ive had good turn out with the Pearl mask too I noticed these mask work better sparingly every few months but not so much when used too often Dont neglect your usual routine but use these like an extra boost , Loved the mask but the nose was cut strangely Areas around my nose that needed attention were exposed , Im a sheet mask lover and have tried tons  this is hands down on of the most runny overly liquidy messy sheet masks Ive used As I was unfolding it it dripped everywhere The other Sephora brand sheet masks Ive tried have been better than this specific one but it isnt terrible , Smells fantastic Not one to wear while walking around as it is just a fabric mask that could potentially slide Better suited to wearing while relaxing or watching tv Very cooling and refreshing Good to store it in the fridge before wearing for that extra punch Felt so good wearing it I didnt want to take it off and my skin looked great afterward , Ive used the strips 3 times once per week I didnt see any dirt or oiliness on the strip after removal , Absolutely horrible The mask was so wet that it just kept sliding around It kept popping up due to the wetness so I kept trying to push it back down That didnt work They say to leave on for fifteen minutes but it was still soaking wet after 20 minutes This is a total waste of time and money Biore was better , It works amazing for Oily skin and breakouts You see the difference after it , This mask is amazing Great product for a low price , It doesnt feel like its really clearing out your skin as some other charcoal masks , The best thing about this mask is the price and the smell Its really refreshing and pleasing I cant vouch for the pore shrinking magic of charcoal as ice only used it once but I will definitely be buying it again , I like switching up my weekly mask and this was a good addition to my rotation Its a little too soggy for me and the fit is a little wonky so I need to adjust it to make it fit better I still like how it makes my skin feel afterwards especially with how oily and acneprone it is , My skin looooves charcoal and this mask I have a lot of problems with acne and this and the bubble mask are my two faves for calming my acne down helping to clear my face of acne and helping to tighten I love using this right after the shower when my face is clean and my pores are more open from the steam I find it helps the most to really let the product work its magic but obvs isnt necessary  , I bought this  its no good dont do it I wish I had gotten it for free , Excellent quality it made my skin so smooth I loved it because it also got my blackheads off of my skinIts just overall AMAZING , I have huge pores and acne prone skin and these masks help tremendously My skin is soft and smooth afterwards , love the way my face looks and feels after using this mask , This is a very good product would highly recommended it if have acne , This mask is soaked with product and drips everywhere so be careful when opening There was also a good amount of product left in the package The mask has a fresh herbal scent and I found the fit to be pretty good on me no adjustments needed It also adheres very well to the skin I dont really have big pores but sometimes I find them more visible and they did appear smaller after the use of this mask The mask felt cool on the skin After removing it the serum sank into my skin leaving it a bit tacky That tackiness wasnt as bad after applying moisturizer My pores also did appear cleaner , Honestly a must get product I had terrible skin by these masks helped so much , The magic properties of this mask have more to do with the charcoal fiber the mask is made from than the serum included It firms up my skin immediately if I use a facial roller or press the mask into my skin It seems to suck out whatever is causing stagnant lymph and puffiness in turn leading to smaller pores I used this mask for the first time today and massaged the fabric into my undereye area and felt a cold sensation from behind both eyeballs My eyes have been feeling extra heavy and sleepy and blurry the past few days and I was happy this cleared it up I am also a huge fan of charcoal konjac sponges which do the same thing , My skin actually looks worse the day after having used this Will certainly not be getting this again , This mask definitely helped after a bad breakout with enlarged pores Unfortunately it had a hard time sticking onto  my face and kept falling off , Had no affect on my pores My skin felt soft after using this product but visibly there was no change , its not that often that you use a mask and right away notice a difference especially for me at least with sheet masks i never find they really do anything out of the ordinary but this mask oh mylanta was amazing i noticed a big difference especially the next morning my pores were significantly smaller skin glowing and clear i used a jade roller in a lymphatic type massage while i had the mask on so im not sure if that helped but i will be repurchasing 15 more of these because they are amazing , Not sure I have used this mask multiple times have about 5 in my drawer right now but I dont know if they work really well I dont see a huge difference in my skin and prefer peal off charcoal masks because you actually see stuff coming out of your skin this is just not for me if u wanna remover pores , It literally did nothing Did not hydrate and definitely did not minimize pores , Overall this was a great mask and my skin felt amazing afterward The only flaw I found with this mask is that I feel like more product was in the packet than on the sheet mask , So I appreciate the shape of this mask plenty of room for my facial features I have big eyes big nose and full lips so I appreciate the masks design It comes with a lot of essence possible too much as some dripped in my eye after application a problem Ive never encountered before with other masks Smells great but its almost too strong and makes me wonder if this product uses a lot of alcohol based fragranca and such I wouldnt buy again or recommend , Jai une peau  problme d  lacn qui persiste  Jai donc des pores dilats  Ce masque diminue lapparence des pores et donne une belle brillance  la peau  Facile  appliquer pas de dgts je recommande sans hsitation , I dont write a lot of reviews but this product is SOOOO BAD I had to I have used other Sephora sheet masks before but the charcoal one is horrible I dont know what they thought faces looked like For a product that used to minimize pores youd think the nose part would fit the bestbut no mater how I move or adjust it my entire nose cant be covered by this mask but other sheet masks work fine for me In addition I question the charcoal aspects to this mask For two reasons 1 from first appearance and touch it didnt look or feel grainy like charcoal does The 2nd charcoal is the 22nd out of 27 ingredients That doesnt sound right to me I purchased two masks online and as I sit writing this review having to constantly readjust the mask Im realized that Ill be exchanging this mask in store so I can look at the ingredients list this time Sephora not cool , Overall it is cut poorly with the eye nose and mouth opening being way too big  Cloth like material does not stay when placed on face , Really like this one , I really liked the softness of my skin after I used this mask but for my skin type normaloily I broke out in pimples the next day I would recommend this to someone who doesnt have very oily skin , LOVE IT  Made my skin feel and look soo good  I got it as an free sample , I have been buying this mask for a while now I really like it my pores look good after using it , A really great mask to help clear skin , I mean it was alright The mask was constantly dripping liquid I feel like it did absolutely nothing for my pores which a majority are on my nose , Although this mask felt nice on the skin I didnt notice any changes I will probably not repurchase , Didnt really love this mask I have oily acne prone skin with large pores I did not see any difference in pores after i took it off or the next day I felt that this mask dried out a lot halfway through the 15 minutes of having it on and did not leave anything behind on my skin to really rub in Kind of felt like a dud i would not repurchase this , I enjoy using the Sephora sheet masks The charcoal one actually removes blackheads , It did nothing for my large pores very drippy I didnt like it at all , Not only did this do nothing for my pores but I also developed 2 underground pimples on my chin the next day And I am over 60 x dont get too many pimples anymore Just felt kind of greasy , My skin has been so clear since I have used this , My skin loves anything charcoal  Affordable and quicklove all the sephora masks but this is my favorite  I can always tell a difference when I use it , It really does work Pores were almost gone next morning  just make sure to wash your face pretty well before using the mask Definitely buying again 3 , I personally didnt feel like it did anything Skin looked exactly the same Wouldnt be able to tell the difference if I just put on a cold really wet piece of paper towel Maybe it takes a couple more tries which is why I didnt give it a 1 , This is one of my favorite Sephora masks Tingles and leaves my skin feeling fresh Ive been using on top of the tarte tingling treatment at night which helps soothe and lock it in , Super stinky perfume smell and very wet that it drips off your face doesnt do any bubble cleanse like the glamglow ones Great disappointment , bought as a birthday gift just waiting to give it to her on friday , Doesnt do much Feels nice when you take it off but doesnt really do anything to your skin , I didnt see much of a difference honestly Maybe if you used this a million times it would do something But it felt nice at least , I loved this product because it really did leave my skin glowing for at least a couple days Never left my skin sticky and left my sensitive skin soft and smooth Might try this mask again , I used this mask for the 1st and I am definitely going back to buy more My skin was fresh and clean after I used I applied it before going to bed and after I didnt apply any product for the night and in the morning I still had that clean and fresh feeling , This is the best mask I have severly dry skin and big pores this mask minimized my pores while also hydrating and preping my skin for make up This is a must have , I love this mask my only complaint the the fact it doesnt have a nose portion like the picture considering that that is where I have the most pores I would of liked for it to cover my nose But overall an amazing face mask feels so refreshing afterwards , This product  like all face masks are too big for my face  I found there to be a lot of extra residue which is not an issue but my skin after felt sticky and my pores did look smaller , Im not a fan of this mask It doesnt feel like its really clearing out your skin as some other charcoal masks do  You dont wash it off and just rub in any excess , I got the opportunity to try to this mask in the newest HolySheetMask Challenge and I am no word of a lie obsessed My fave masks to use are charcoal since they cleanse my skin AND SC has one of the best Ive usedDisclosure I participated in a sponsored campaign with Sephora Collection , I recently participated in a sponsored campaign with Sephora Collection to try out their new masks I honestly love the sheet masks I tried the charcoal because I was having minor break outs and was hopeful this would help and it did My skin is so smooth after using it and I noticed my pores arent as clogged as they were They are easy to use and apply Would highly recommend , Charcoal has been such a huge craze and I am obsessed I was a little skeptical to try this as a sheet mask but I am obsessed It leaves my skin feeling fresh and fierce I participated in a Sephora campaign with this mask , I am totally obsessed with sheet masks and especially charcoal They are so easy to apply and leave your skin feeling fresh and clean Definitely recommend , I participated in a sponsored campaign with Sephora Collection and I got to try this amazing mask Yes you will look scary but your skin will look and feel AMAZING afterward I highly recommend it its easy to apply and great to scare your boyfriend when he gets home lol , I participated in a sponsored campaign with sephora collection Along with the other products I received this one and I loved it Gave me a deep and fresh clean Cant wait to try more products from this line , I partnered with Sephora Collection for their face mask campaign  I LOVED this mask Putting my make up on afterwards it looked so much better and my pores were hardly even visible and pores is something I really struggle with I love this product , Charcoal for the win I have been incorporating charcoal based products into my beauty routine because I believe it is skins no longer best kept secret I left this on my face for 15 minutes after I got out of the shower and my skin looked clean refined and just purified I am a big fan of sheet masks and I loved the quality of the actual sheet It was not too flimsy or too large and uncomfortable how some just get in your hair or on your ears I would definitely recommend this sheet mask I did want to note I participated in a sponsored campaign with Sephora Collection but I genuinely loved this product , This mask is awesome  It was my first time trying out this type of sheet mask and I loved how my skin felt afterwards  I participated in a sponsored campaign by Sephora , I received this mask as a part of a sponsored campaign with sephora collection It is super purifying and refreshing , I love the charcoal masks so much Immediately after I took off the mask my skin was super radiant and glowing Im so excited to have more facemask nights with my gfs Thanks to Sephora Collection for letting me participate in this sponsored campaign I cant wait to try the rest , Ive always been a big fan of charcoal because of the many benefits it has for your skin which is why I was super excited to try this one out I have large pores and this mask helped minimize them while leaving my skin feeling rejuvenated and fresh I will be using it again Disclosure I participated in a sponsored campaign with Sephora Collection , I participated in a sponsored campaign with Sephora Collection and received this mask I absolutely LOVE IT You can feel it working as soon as you put it on My skin felt amazing after using it and it really does minimize your pores I would for sure recommend this mask for anyone with large pores and for deep cleansing , I love this charcoal mask  I can feel is purifying my skin as it sits on my face My skin feels fresh and smooth after use I would definitely recommend this product Disclosure participated in sponsored campaign with Sephora Collection , I personally love mud masks I always feel like they mattify my skin and detoxes it too I liked this mask because it was really practical as opposed to other mud masks where you have to scrub your face for days in order for the mask to come off I feel like my skin looked tighter after and I would def use this again , I have been into charcoal EVERYTHING lately and this mask was such a treat I love the way the sheet masks seem to really help the product absorb into my skin and how you can feel it working I got this mask sent to me in a pack from Sephora and this one was my fav , This mask did nothing for me I thought it would be more like a charcoal nose strip I rather have had another bubble sheet mask , Im a big fan of Sephora sheet masks This one is well constructed and comfortable like the others Ingredients dont irritate my skin Thats why this gets 3 stars but it did nothing for my pores I have very large pores and this didnt minimize them or blur them Since pore minimizing is all this mask claims to do I wont be repurchasing Maybe it will work for someone with smaller pores , Sheet masks are part of my daily skin care routine I have my favorites but I always make sure to try new ones a few times a week Sephora sheet masks are of really good quality so I was excited when 4 new ones dropped This mask is absolutely wonderful Its drenched in essence anybody doing sheet masks regularly knows its a great thing smells very clean adheres to the face easily and stays perfectly put for a long time I also loved the black color of the mask itself There was enough essence in the pouch to use it on my shoulders and arms Since the mask itself was so generously soaked in essence I was able to apply the essence all over my neck and chest My skin really enjoyed this mask It felt purified relaxed and hydrated after I took it off Wonderful experience overall , I dripped everywherethe liquid it is soaked in drips the entire time It didnt stay flush with my face so the ends peeled back at my chin and just dripped My skin seemed a little smoother but I think Ill still with the mud mask from glam glow , I love this mask I have moderate to severe acne and I am trying to clear up my face for vacation This mask sure did the trick After one use my skin felt smoother My pores were not as big and noticeable as before and my blackheads were gone This mask also minimized my acne I highly recommend this product"
Self-Tanning Body Mousse,"I was beyond disappointed that they discontinued the Sephora tanning mist So I gave this a try I like that its pretty easy to apply no streaks dries pretty quickly and its buildable but the SMELL Omg its atrocious With the original Sephora spray I could put it on and not have to shower after and it had no scent And this one looks so good when I wake up some fades after the shower but theres no way I can not shower after leaving it all night the smell is so bad that sometimes even after I shower I can STILL smell it If they did something about the smell it would be a decent tanner But its not for those who want to be really really dark its a pretty natural colour and I dont find it orange at all after one use I have a bit of a glow after 2 uses its more noticeable , No allergic reaction or itching thankfully great gradual and natural color Ordered my second bottle I have never had the bruised knees look or color buildup on the backs of my ankles which is a gift from so many others I have tried Just works for me , I have used various self tanners for decades and can honestly say I have never had one that did NOTHING until now I liked everything else about iteasy application with thin foam the self tanner scent wasnt bad and the price was excellent However none of those things matter when it gives you ZERO color I exfoliated prior showered and then applied The next day I applied again and then tried a third time just to make sure it didnt need more build When I say no color I mean it did nothing Despite it being cheap I still went back to the store and returned it Will stick with my go to drugstore brands for now , Definitely a more natural self tanner But thats what I was looking for If it smelled better though , Smells bad and didnt work at all Like literally no change in colour They used to have a spray that was a nice colour and worked well I would definitely suggest paying a little more for a different brand , If you want orange skin go for itIm so disappointed and it smelled exactly like apple cider vinegarThe day after you put that on it will get even more orange be careful , First time tanner here I enjoy the light weight feel its not heavy on the skin , Seriously amazing dont need a sponge to spread comes out as white foam and leaves no streaks I hop in the white sheets after and it never leaves a mark I love love love it Ive bought 3 bottles so far and a bottle of the face self tanner , Il faut savoir quil sagit dun autobronzant graduel je ne mattendais pas  cela dun autobronzant en mousse Ayant la peau assez ple jai tout de mme trouv quune couche donnait un hle bonne mine , Please bring back the spray tan version This one doesnt even come close What a disappointment , This is by far my favourite tanning product This is definitely more on the natural side and I would agree is buildable I love that I can apply at night and wake up with a golden color not orange or grey looking and I sometimes dont even rinse off I like the runny mouse as I find one pump can do each arm and two pumps for each leg Also doesnt stain my sheets or clothing Already on my third bottle , Completely completely bummed For over 5 years I used the Sephora Tinted Self tanning mist and loved it I cant believe it was discontinued I wouldve ordered 10 more of them if I couldve So I tried this Sephora tanning body mousse And it is NOT a mousse it is a watery foamy mess I waited to see if it would be a buildable tan for me and nothing I have used it four times in the past 24 hours to build on the tan and cannot even tell that I darkened at all Its an awful mess I Purposely did not put it on my belly so I could tell the difference in what is my real body color and what is the buildable tan color and there is no difference after four applications in 24 hours One Must have to be really pale for this to show up I have Mediterranean olive skin when in the sun however I have not been in the sun so I have no real tan Im pretty pale Such a disappointment Dont spend your money on it and Sephora Bring back the Sephora tinted body mist , Great sun kissed color without the worry of damage from sun rays This lightweight mousse applies easily and absorbs quickly It smells nice and left my skin feeling hydrated but not sticky It creates a nice builldable color I love it and its my new goto self tanner of the season I have yellow undertones to my skin and it didnt look orangey or fake see photos , It spreads nicely but barely makes a difference and literally none after one application Also disappears quickly and smells like tanner , Not a big fan  I give it two stars because the tan is natural looking and buildable but thats about all that great about this product  Im not sure why they call it mousse its more like a foam  Its not easy to rub on because its so runny and the smell is extremely unpleasant   Ill continue to use it until its gone but wouldnt purchase again , a donne un effet trs trs naturel Je ne vois pas une norme diffrence pour tre bien honnte , Applied the first layer as soon as I got out of the shower after I exfoliated  I applied it with the st tropez tanning mitt It is pretty sticky for about a half hour so I wait till Im not sticky to put clothes on I didnt tell a difference if it developed after the first layer  my husband couldnt tell either I let it sit for about 4 hours then I went in for a second layer  slept through the night I didnt have any staining on my sheets  I woke up this morning with a deep tan Its a beautiful glow as well Not streaky at all  not Orange It has a very strong tanning smell that lingers all day I still smell it on me now It smells like jergens natural glow Highly recommend The foam comes out white so you dont see where you rubbed but theres no streaking at all Im lightmed  I have a subtle tan from Laying outside for a few days but this took my tan to a whole new level Really impressed with this , Super super streaky Im surprised no one else had this issue I rubbed it in really well and followed the instructions and Ive been trying different self tanners for about 20 years but this left such dark streaks Ill definitely be wearing pants until this washes off , Perfect for anyone with fair skin Amazingly subtle bronze glow It isnt a huge wow you went on vacation tan but it gives a healthy not orangey colour Still smells like self tanner and is a bit sticky for the first 30 mins after application but I havent had any issues with colour transfer or anything Obviously like all self tanning products make sure you exfoliate before use and I would recommend a tanning mitt so you dont get colour on your palms , I have had many terrible experiences when it comes to self tanner as Im pretty pale but this stuff is MAGIC I used the st tropez mitt to apply and I was left with a streak free glow I was apprehensive about purchasing considering its not light to medium but I couldnt be happier with the results I didnt want anything too intense so I did a very light application and this exceeded my expectations , I love the fact you dont have to wash this off when you use it It dries very quickly and doesnt feel sticky personally I wait around 1520 minutes before putting on clothes overtop As others said it is a relatively subtle tan which I like since you can build up instead of it being too dark too fast The only downside is the mousse is clear so it can be hard to tell exactly where you are putting it and if it is even I also found that the tan develops over 24 hours instead of the stated 3 hours when they recommend putting a second coat on for a deeper tan , Its okay for a super light wash of color The pros are that it goes on clear doesnt smell and doesnt fade patchy at all I use it on my face too and it gives very subtle color I have a light olive complexion Sephora please make a darker option , I am new to selftanning and I love this Not too dark upon first application good price not streaky and is buildable I will definitely purchase again , Not loving this as it didnt give much color Its great otherwise goes on smoothly and doesnt smell bad Just doesnt give a whole lot of color , Loved it Very similar to Bondi Sands tan products except this one didnt dry my skin out and it also didnt have that typical sunless tanner odour A nice golden colour Nothing to dark and NOT orange just a natural day in the sun look  Will be buying again for sure , I used to use the Bondi Sands mousse religiously until this one There is no colour guard Smell is typically fake tan smell no coconut Id say one application is similar to the medium Isle of Paradise products and a second application is smiler to the dark products A lot of self tanning products in general I find really dries out my skin but this one doesnt Fading isnt patchy and last Id say 45 days I like to use isle of paradise drops or their tanning butter to touch up Overall a great more affordable productdupe to St Tropez and Bondi Sands mousse , This self tan is easy to apply although the mousse is white no colour guard so there isnt an immediate colour payoff  The result isnt super dark  Its a soft even tan  If youre looking to become a few shades darker this isnt that drastic  Id give it 3 stars but its getting 4 because the ingredient list and the fade isnt patchy , Im giving this 3 stars because I didnt look orange and the colour was pretty natural sunkissed There was no staining on my clothes or sheets which I was very thankful for The tan didnt last very long on my skin abut 2 days but I also shower often and use exfoliating mitts However one coat is definitely not enough with this stuff I was expecting it to be fair but I was kind of disappointed that I had to go in its a second application Also this stuff smells so strong of the fake tan scent and it lingers on clothes Honestly I would repurchase this again if it wasnt for the smell , Holy Cow Ok I have to admit this was my first time using self tanner and I was highly doubtful about the whole process I am glowing The tan looks completely natural and is even throughout my body I do not look orange As a pasty white woman I wanted to even my complexion from my yellow tone tanned shoulders to my blue toned hands and it did just that , love love love very soft buildable and natural color I put it on two nights straight to build a deeper color and I probably could have done a third for a more dramatic color Not orange whatsoever applied evenly and faded beautifully Does has a slight self tanner smell but didnt bother me Slept in it overnight and didnt get on my bedding at all Looked like I just got back from a weekend trip in the sun , this met all my hopes i love the undertone of this not orange like most self tanners if you have an olive undertone on the lightmedium side this is perfect for you its not super dark but after the first application wait three hours and apply again for a deeper tan this is also mess free and did not stain my white sheets gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because i did reapply twice for a deeper tan but not a big deal at all for me i will continue to buy this leave this forever please "
Sephora City Reusable Water Bottle,"The top of the bottle cracked from opening and closing the lid appropriately 8 times Still using but wouldnt order again due to lack of quality , Cute water bottle that I used only 3 times because it cracked from the bottom and spilled my water everywhere This plastic water bottle is made from super cheap plastic and you have to be careful with it Its not durable so dont drop itit will BREAK I liked it a lot because it was a good size and fit perfectly in my purpose but very fragile Wont last , High quality hefty water bottle on the smaller side , Dont expect anything fancy Its a plain clear bottle with a metal type cap and a simple Sephora logo on it I would recommend to NOT freeze it to avoid damaging it I got it for just under 5 and I cant complain Its cute simple and great for drinking water , Extremely cheap water bottle I wanted to be excited about it but unfortunately it cracked after 4 uses This is not Sephora quality and should be redesigned or NOT sold at all , A perfect size for carrying when out and about Sturdy and keeps water nice and cold , When I saw the water bottle in the Sephora store I loved it straight away and purchased the New York bottle However after the second use the bottle cracked I have since reordered another bottle New York was no longer available so I have ordered Miami A bit disappointed as not to Sephoras high standards , Cracked very easily It also came dirty and its plasticI just ended up throwing it out , I didnt want to listen to these reviews since the bottle looked so cute and I thought it couldnt be that bad The bottle neck literally cracked after a week of use and I continued using it despite that for a couple weeks by being careful not to close it too tight as to crack it further It cracked even more eventually and water started leaking so I had to stop Lasted a total of 35 weeks So much for a cute sephora bottle lol , After First use  Its plastic look like so cheap and its looking so ugly I am not recommending this one to any one , Sephora doesnt  Toronto rude but fair so I opted for this Hawaii variant which had the cutest lettering I have never been to Hawaii but I have been known to vibe to Don Ho now and again This bottle is very cute and at 20 oz a good little slink of water It gets nice and cold and is rather refreshing This is an incredibly cheaply made product however I have had it for a week or so and there are already cracks forming where the lid screws on The very act that makes it a water bottle is destroying it from the inside It was ten dollars which is cheap for Sephora but expensive for a poorly made vessel I have found sturdier options at the dollar store Still this thing makes me smile so Ill drink from it until it bursts open in my hands or slices my lips open or I leave it behind somewhere stupid , I love my water bottles Bought 2 New York ones and one Washington DC to keep in my water bottle rotation stash Had 2 of them for many months and bought an extra one last week I have read that others have had the words scratched off with use Mine have been perfectly fine all these months But that may be because that is my goal to keep the designs intact as long as possible Bought the bottles because I am very sentimental and want and expect the designs to last for some time So far its working , Plastic cute design but not long lasting scratches easily words fade , I really love this bottle but has already gotten small cracks on the opening where I put ice in , Must have to carry in your purse in 2021 Stop wasting money on buying bottled water , love this bottle they didnt have any city near me but grabbed the city that I love to go on vacation I will admit its cheap but its also not a pricey bottle its faired through quite a good amount of hand washes without the letters coming off so I am pretty impressed Hopefully more cities come to the selections , The plastic on this is very cheap the only reason I bought it is because I live in sf and thought it would be a good souvenir I wouldnt actually use this since it seems like the words would come off this bottle"
Smoothing Cleanser,"Cleansed my face well and did not dry it out however there are better cleansers out there , Its working  Have had people comment on a noticeable improvement , I wear a mask for 1216 hours a day at work and my skin was SUFFERING until I started using this cleanser My breakouts are far and few between now , I have only had the product two weeks but I like it very much I love the price for the size of the product and its effective ness I like that it cleanses but does not leave my skin feeling dry I bought it because of the AHAs and BHAs Hopefully this will make a difference in the long run , very effective my skin feels very hydrated after using , Love i always repurchase makes my skin nice and soft  , I have used more expensive brands for cleansers from Sephora and this cleanser has been beating them Im 49 and have normal to combo skin This cleaner has me with clear radiant skin Love it , I have never minded the scent of products but this one was extremely strong  unpleasant I would rinse my face thoroughly and the sent still lingered in my nose and mouth I tried it with my silicon face scrubber and hanxs but the scent was still bery pungent , a gentle cleanser too gentle for my preference I would need another product to take my makeup off before using this to wash my face theres only so many times I want to scrub my face before its actually cleaned good for sensitive skin I imagine big meh for me , I enjoyed this and have repurchased I cant tell if its actually doing anything to my skin in terms of smoothing it but its mild enough that it doesnt irritate my skin compared to other cleaners I have sensitive skin , Works well as a cleanser but has almost a slick feeling to it Leaves my skin feeling smooth but I will often double cleanse to ensure all my make up has room removed Overall a really good product , I have super sensitive skin that hates 999 of face washes I was looking for one with some sort of exfoliant since I was getting clogged pores everywhere and nothing else was working until I tried this , I was a tried and true ExfoliKate user for a solid few years they were out of stock and an employee recommended this as a substitute and Ive been using it ever since It spells really nice and its gentle on the skin while still leaving it feeling clean also a little goes a long way so the bottles last a good few months Definetly recommend , 100010 The price packaging FORMULA everything is absolutely perfect I use this once sometimes twice a day and have combo skin and workout frequently and this keeps my skin so smooth and clean , I used this product for the first time cause it was my sisters i had to buy it for myself I love it so much It has cleared up my skin and now i dont even have to wear makeup to feel pretty , I am loving this cleanser I can see a difference in my skin complexion My face feels so soft after using during the pat dry process , Gentle cleanser helped corrected my skin barrier along with other products , I hate the smell of this it does not come off and it does not work It dont Try take us to makeup and after washing it off you still smell it , i used to use the regular sephora collection facial wash  if this isnt it its the same one this one focuses more on oily skin types which is definitely me im definitely a foam soap face cleanser kinda gal i do believe  its extremely gentle with no exfoliation beads in the product whatsoever i went from using the yacht facial cleanser to this one its nice but obviously better budget wise , I bought this on a whim and I am so happy I did It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean Its nice and light and a great way to start my morning off Ive noticed an improvement in my skin after using it Each time I try a different one I always find my self going back to this Great price point and keeps my skin happy , I love this cleanser  been using is for about 3 months and I can definitely see the difference I dont break out as much either Fragrance free a total plussss , this works wonders for me i was really nervous because i have issues with dermatitis and acne i had been using the skin fix cleanser but was needing something less expensive this cleanser has made my skin so smooth and clear , Love this simple and effective cleanser No extra frills just great skincare at a great price , it improved my skin texture a lot especially my forehead which is now much smoother , It smells a little synthetic but it hasnt caused any issues so Im settling on 3 stars But if youre going to buy something thats drugstore quality might as well go to a drugstore and pay drugstore prices , Ive been using this cleanser for about 2 weeks so far I had been using Cetaphil for a long time previously but I decided I wanted my cleanser to work a little harder for me which is exactly what this one has done My skin is much smoother and my breakouts have already lessened big time A little goes a long way you really dont need very much at a time which is great since theres only the one size of tube The bottle does warn that the active ingredients can cause sun sensitivity so be sure to use some SPF if youre heading outside I personally have been outside in the sun everyday since using this with SPF and havent had any issues with sensitivity or sunburns If youre looking for a cleanser that will put in some work without emptying your wallet this is a great one to try Im glad I decided to try this one first before jumping into a super expensive cleanser assuming more money means more better which this cleanser proves definitely isnt true Photo is a close up of my left cheek which used to be a problem break out spot for me but is actually clear now , It does the job ive noticed my skin is smoother lasts a while since you dont need much pretty simple good ingredients , No where on this page does it say there is a UV Exposure warning on this product I went to use it last night and it says to not be in direct sunlight for up to a week after use I am so happy I gave you money for a product that will just hit the trash , Another great product from Sephora  Does a great job cleaning my skin without any residue  I love the fact that its clean no icky chemicals and again the price point is good  Winwin overall  Will definetly be purchasing again , I used this product consistently for over 90 days and saw zero improvement Im happy that others like it though but its not for me and my skin , Honestly I usually buy expensive products but I thought Id try out some less costly options I didnt like the Sephora makeup removing balm I tried but I love this cleanser It definitely makes my skin feel smoother and it cleanses well I will repurchase this product , Pleasantly surprised by this cleanser Loved that it cleaned my skin No issues whatsoever with this product , This is my favorite cleanser I love using it before applying Vitamin C because the acids in the cleanser I think help the Vitamin C to penetrate the skin better Its effective yet gentle Great product and also so inexpensive Never stop making this please , Skin feels fresh and exfoliated  A little goes a long way  My breakouts have decreased since I started using , Love it Just got it wash my face and felt completely soft after , Bless this cleanser Its gel type and yet foams up quite well Took me few days to get used to the odd gel texture but now its my fav exfoliating cleanser Didnt expect it to also remove my waterproof makeup I double cleanse and it doesnt irritate my skin even as an acne prone skin type , I am obsessed with thus fave wash It doesnt strip off your face from its natural oils after the wash yet it leaves you with a feeling of a clean and fresh skin I will definitely order another one , I have struggled with skin texture and tiny bumps on my chin and forehead for years and nothing has worked I was previously issuing Glow Recipes  Watermelon Toner hoping it would help with my texture but it never worked After using this cleanser for only a week I already see a dramatic improvement in my skins texture and my skin is so soft and smooth I have dry skin and it doesnt dry it out at all Highly highly recommend , This is by far the best face cleaner Ive used It gives a deep clean and leaves skin feeling fresh and smooth , This product is amazing  leaves my skin feeling so clean without drying it out Works wonders for preventing breakouts  100 recommend  , My go to every day gentle cleanser I have no complaints my skin hasnt had any major breakouts since I started using this cleanser knock on wood My skin feels refreshed after use not dry or stripped , I LOVE this Clean at Sephora Cleanser I can not contain my excitement for this cleanser I switched from Murad Hydrating cleanser to this guy and I am so happy I love the no fragrance gel consistency This cleanser foams up beautifully and I appreciate the AHABHA This cleanser is helping to smooth my skin from all the bumps from having to wear a mask , All this does for me is strip my skin and dry it out Do not recommend , Absolutely amazing I will only be using Sephora brand cleansers from now on , I have sensitive skin and this doesnt irritate my skin , Wanted it to be a dupe of the DDG AHABHA cleanser while my local store was sold out It smells kind ofrotten Like when a face product turns And definitely nothing like the resurfacing cleansers from DDG or PTR Some smoothing I might have finished it at this price point if it didnt smell so bad , I had help from one of the sephora employees at the store he recommended me this product it didnt help what I was really looking atMy skin was dry before I got this product and I told him I needed something for my acne prone skin and for my clogged pores It didnt help with that it made my skin normal but it ive been using it for almost two weeks and it made my skin break out more and made my skin red really easily , Im amazed at how cheap this cleanser is considering what it does This is the best exfoliating cleanser Ive ever used hands down My skin gets very easily irritated by higher concentrations of acids especially BHA and Im assuming that the concentrations are relatively low in this cleanser since they arent specified The other 100 reviews arent lying when they say this is gentle  so gentle I can use it twice a day everyday But despite that it still works My skin has never been smoother no flakiness or dehydration even though this winter has been especially harsh and so clear And clean and fragrance free to boot Im a bit annoyed with myself that I was paying over 3X as much for a cleanser that admittedly I also liked but I like this one even better Dont change a thing Sephora you nailed it , I loveee this cleanser Leaves my face smooth and soft lathers really nicely and no scent Helps keep my skin clear with the BHA and AHA I dont have bad acne just occasional spots and this clears them up in a day or 2 just try it  , Really good product for any type of skin in my opinion Its so lightweight  makes my skin feel refreshed Its reassuring to know youre applying clean products to your skin  doesnt create imbalance , I have combo skin and finding the right cleanser can be tricky After one use of this product I noticed my skin looked brighter and felt smoother Ill definitely continue using this cleanser , I have sensitive skin and this product is go gentle for my skin I love how clean and healthy the ingredients are This is a good everyday cleanser and works well with the

experience After using the Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser for a few weeks I can confidently say this has changed my skin for the better I have very sensitive skin and this product is not too harsh or overpowering on my face I love how clean the ingredients are and how they are cruelty free I am always looking to find brands with clean ingredients and morals when it comes to creating their products and Sephora always creates the best quality items for an awesome price I went and bought this product for my sister after using it for a few weeks because of the noticeable difference in my complexion For 10 this is an absolute steal of a deal If you are looking for a sign to buy this GO ORDER IT , After using this cleanser a couple of times a week I can happily say I have seen a

with the BHA spot clearing gel and the moisturizer ive never had breakouts this bad happen to me before butbecause of school stress and constant work it was bound to happen like i said i got it about a month or so ago so if it was supposed to do something it would have by now and it seems like it just keeps infecting my old pimples and acne spots from the amount of times they came back in the span of a month im always consistent with it and tried so hard to give it a chance but its gotten past the pore purging part and i finally ran out of patience with it its never ending and didnt change anything about my skin and you can see that the before and after pictures are literally the same if anything just a waste of money , I have acneprone sensitive skin and this cleanser has been stellar It doesnt break me out and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest opinion , Tried this since they discontinued the AMA Clean Skin

Supplement Case,"Broke before I got to use it  good concept but not very well made , This little box is a great size for travelling and the multiple compartments are great but they dont keep whats inside them fresh I put vitamin C tablets in the largest compartment and went away for a four day trip and even on the first day the tablets were soggy The compartments are obviously not air tight Which is fine if you have like capsules or something but for a regular powder type tablet they will not be crunchy and fresh like they are in a bottle if you keep them in this container , I love this case It is the perfect size and amount of compartments for what I need Way cuter than the options available on Amazon It has held up great for months going strong , Disappointed with the poor quality of material used to make this case The plastic is off and sharp around the edges Overall not a quality case for Sephora to put its brand on , As someone who permanently carries allergy meds pain meds lactose pills etc this pill box organizes all my pills perfectly Much better than my old crusty bottle I reused from the pharmacy that I had to fight with every time because of course the one pill I need is at the bottom Traveled with it a few times and it fits everywhere while saving so much space , I love the idea of the product but it came with so many defects The top compartment wouldnt close and there seemed to be a disfigurement in one of the plastic closers , i love this as someone who only takes a couple of supplements a day it holds them all perfectly also handy for travel  , Looks cute but as many other reviews say the plastic covers suck , smaller than I expected but easy carry in pursehave three sections would be better to have more sections , This case is a must have for me So compact but holds a lot I own 2 already and just ordered a 3rd Was able to fit 35 pills inside recently And still had space for a few more , The case is tinier than you might expect but its an absolutely awesome jewelry case for a frequent traveller like me Keeps all of my small jewelry untangled and in one place Im ordering another one as we speak colodoesnt s , Its cute A lot smaller than I thought it would be though , Smaller than I was expecting couldnt fit what I needed and the compartments didnt latch well I will find something else to use it for but it wont cut it for what I needed I prefer the bigger one , super cute i love the pink and its a great way to keep myself on track of my supplements without this i have found it hard to keep up with taking them regularly but this has been a game changer , I have bought about 4 of these because i just love it Its so dainty small but somehow fits so many of my prescription pills It really helps keep me organized with the compartments it has Will continue to repurchase so that I have a box everywhere and never forget to take my meds , Much smaller than it looks in the pictures and the inner lids broke for me almost instantly and no longer close Waste of money very disappointed that Sephora would put their name on this , I loved this case until it broke only 3 months after purchase with very minimal use The plastic cover to the large compartment snapped It still holds my pills for now until I can find a better one VERY disappointed in Sephora for putting their name on such a cheap product , I have a few supplement cases and this is my favorite for everyday use Its not clunky and fits in smaller purses It comes with multiple compartments that it allows me to carry my daily essentials The color is pretty and it doesnt get dirty easily The tabs stay lock while still remaining easy to open Ive brought it with me on trips and it works great but keep in mind it does not hold much so dont expect it to carry everything all the time , Exactly as pictured Good quality Keeps my pills organized on the go No complaints , I bought it cause I thought it was super cute to hold my daily vitamins in it but the clasp pretty much would not hold and broke to hold it closed and the bigger inner part the clasp did not hold either Threw it out after only a couple weeks unfortunately , This pillowcase is excellent It has several different size places to put pills that fits everything I would recommend this to anybody in fact my daughters have bought this supplement case T may beAs you can see in the picture its well worn , this box is cute but it is super small I had to return it , Love it  Just added another supplement to my daily routine   Hoping it will help my thyroid and adrenal so I can one day fill it up with just capsules  Glad the capsule fits in this I thought it would be a bit bigger but the size actually is great So much neater and takes up less space than the 3 bottles Now I need to get a pouch for my liquids , This is the cutest little thing  I purchased this to be able to put my daily meds in instead of carrying  pill bottles in my purse  Im not on a ton of meds but I do have a few routine ones  It is tiny and compact but does the job  It closes securely so no worries if pills everywear in your purse  I highly recommend this little baby , Compartments are so useful but the inner lids sometimes not that easy to open , This is the perfect size to carry medication A few times Ive forgotten to take them when I wake up so instead of skipping an entire day I take them a few hours later which is still fine Its small which I love and fits in my makeup bag in my purse , Its perfect for what its needed for My only complaint is I would like a different color option Its compact cute holds just enough and durable I dont know what the other users are doing to theirs to cause them to break Ive had mine for nearly two years My husband actually stole or from me and colored it with a sharpie He loves it too sans the color , love the case but I have had this for 3 months and look at the top  its doing something weird with the plastic on the top and bottom but the inside is fine it just looks gross now waste of money , The other reviews are true Mine broke after only a few months This case is cute but not functional at all Please save your money and find a case that is better quality , I love it  Practical and small  Sturdy and good quality Just what I was looking for , The case itself is cute and a good small size Great concept Broke within a month , Broke within the first month I got it Snapped in half poor quality , Best pill case ever I have gotten one for everyone in my family It fits way more than you would think but is still small and easily fits in my purse , Trash broke as soon and I opened it and I never used it I dont recommend at all Dont waste your money Dollar tree has better quality for less money , Perfect for my needs   I love this product so much  I have used many medication holders but this by far is my favorite the color  the size  the number of compartments and the for sure closed snap snap The d do ensures you wont have a purse full of lint filled meds in your hands , This is tinier than expected even though I read reviews explaining so it cant fit many of my large multivitamins or omega liquidgels HOWEVER the compartments are very sturdy and close very securely , Love the size of this Perfect for a weekendweek getaway , Super handy its practical and many compartments for organization I have one so does my dad now , Love how small and practical this little case is , This case is so cute and love the seperate compatments and the pink shade it comes in is very prettyeasy to put in my purse as a nice small size , I hate the generic pill containers Theyre too big and awkward While this one is shockingly small it holds a lot and is different from the generic cases in all the right ways , Im a longtime fan of Sephora collection products but this pill case is not it Cheaply made hard to open as the compartment doors are so delicate I take v good care of my stuff and still managed to break it v disappointed if the quality I have another plastic pill case in a similar style that has been going strong for 7 years now theres no reason for this one to break on me after a couple of months Its too bad because the design is quite practical and aesthetically pleasing Just dont expect much in terms of durability , Great case for daily supplements and to pack along roadtrip , Buy it  Now Small but fits a weeks worth of supplements , I will say this is a little smaller than I thought it would be But its still also perfect , After some changes in my health Ive had to start taking a variety of pills and needed help managing them This thing is great Its small so it fits in any purse bag or pocket and has the right amount of space for all I need  even the basic Advils and daily vitamins The only thing I wish is that it come in other colours Other than that a perfect purchase , I love this case and still use it but I have a few complaints I threw it into my black purse and it was stained black along the edges It is also somewhat fragile when opening the little compartments I thought I broke it the first time using it I now keep it on my nightstand instead of traveling with it because Im afraid it will break apart while Im away from the house You can definitely get sturdier pill cases on Amazon for cheaper as well Its a cute pink color initially but now mine is half stained black from putting it in a purse that was years old , I love the case but I just got it and when I put it in daylight it has discolouration on all of the corners , Weirdly obsessed I have this in my purse all the time Its so handy to have , Main hinge snapped when I opened the small compartments Didnt get even one use out of it Very flimsy Looking at similar products most have a sturdier larger hinge , This supplement case is simple and easy to use The clasps are strong enough to stop any compartments from opening I personally love the size of each compartment as they fit my medications perfectly The color is a true muted pink tone and a nice size to keep on your bedside table or throw in your purse , Small This would not hold many days of pills so for me not a useful travel case Ok if you only take 1 kind of pillvitamin , I have chronic pain and I have a pill case for my daily use but I keep a spare daily dose of everything in this so I dont miss a beat when I sleep over at a friendsboys house or do an overnight trip  Has enough room for two days and I take like 15 pills meds and supplements a day , I love this little case Its super convenient for all of my daily vitamins and supplements , I love this Its hard to find a small case with multiple dividers I used it for travel and got one for my sister , This case is great I have been looking for one as my vitamin intake has increased but was unable to find a suitable replacement for the one I had until I saw this oneso I bought it back in August and I love it As you can see from the photos mine has managed to stay clean in spite of being tossed in my lunch bag everyday and nothing has broken either even though its packed to the brim Id buy it again , Such a cute case Doesnt look like a pill case which I love , A great pill case I have a lot of them so this keeps them separate and neatly organized I deducted one star because one of the compartments snaps is difficult to get open each time Hopefully it doesnt end up breaking as with other reviewers cases Id like to buy a second one so Im hoping its back in stock soon , I really love this little case    I keep it in my purse filled with eyeglass wipes perfume samples and medications   Im purchasing one for my backpack and another for my moms stockingI have had no issues at all with the plastic snaps   Maybe there was just a bad batch , this case is functionally really good at a nice size with a range of compartment sizes it WOULD look good too if whatever coating they put on the case to give it the soft touch feel didnt get stained almost immediately its impossible to clean off too it looks dirty all the time and while i know what i store inside is ok its annoying to look at ill use this case until it breaks but i wouldnt purchase it again , Little plastic piece that keeps the container shut broke off after 1 use , Cute and compact but gets dirty easily and mine has already broken in half so i trashed it I think it should come in black not that color , Im adrenal insufficient so I need to take varying dosages of medicine 3x per day a Monday thru Friday organizer isnt practical theres too many compartments So this pill case is PERFECT its small sturdy and keeps me organized its more pink than it looks in my photos nice matte finish , Perfect for weekend or short trips Works better than those Sun to Sat pill cases from the pharmacy that never seem to fit my supplements in the same compartment or baggies Looks cute and keeps my supplements organized and in one place Definitely worth the money and has made my travelling much easier I take a lot of supplements so Im going to purchase another one Just wish it came in different colors , Super nice pill case I personally really like the size You can fit a lot for such a tiny container I throw both my prescriptions and vitamins in and feel much better having it sit on my bathroom vanity , Love this little case  Im happy with the size as I have to carry a few medications with me daily  Lots of compartments  Ive had this for a few months and open it numerous times daily and has help up , size is small but not bad for throwing in your purse the biggest problem is that the matte soft finish gets VERY dirty tried to use alcohol and a magic eraser to clean and still didnt do anything , I appreciate the separated compartments within the case itself Very cute color , Broke after two uses Definitely not worth it and I cant even return it because its been over two months , Weird size A little too clumsy and klutzy  and bulky for me , This fits all of my medication perfectly for on the go Would highly recommend , I bought this case and its perfect in size but it broke after a week of use Waste of money , I love this case Not sure why the negative reviews This is perfect for travel , Really cute and sturdy I just bought two more for family Have had this in my purse and not once has it popped open , Smaller than it looks Its a palm size box that has four compartments I actually like the fact that it is so compact and I can fit in in almost all purses I have I take lots of collagen pills throughout a day so the biggest compartment on the top lid is perfect for that Lower three compartments I have two different vitamins and probiotics The soft capsules are not getting sticky as long as you store the case away from the steamy food or coffee Im loving the smooth feel of the casing and its soft pink colour , So cute and compact Fits my caffeine Midol and claritin pills perfectly and is small enough to take very little space Love love love , I didnt have mine very long and it broke I wanted to really like it and I did until it broke so easily I definitely do not recommend whatsoever , Cute but its more of a mauvey grey color than millenial pink as shown , Very chic little pillsupplement case and it seems like great quality , Perfect size for carrying daily supplementsmedicines I have a chronic condition and use this to carry around any supplements needed in for the day in my purse Made vacationstraveling so much easier , Took off a star because like another reviewer stated the covers to each compartment arent hinged and it wouldnt be practical for everyday use because eventually the covers would probably break off  For me I just wanted a small supplement case to take on a few short vacations each year and itll be perfect for that , Kind of expensive for a plastic pull case but holds plenty of vitamins supplements ibuprofen or whatever a gal needs to have in hand  Perfect size to toss in your bag , The perfect tiny pill case for travel The compartments keep things really organized I keep my biotin gummy vitamins in the big compartment Pepto Advil and a multivitamin in the other Perfect for travel essentials , I love this little case It fits nicely in my small crossbody Ugg bag I use it to hold Tylenol Pamprin Benadryl and Zantec You never know when you might need something like that Its nice to have them with me while out , So I definitely recommend this just not for vitamins and supplements I dont wear a lot of jewelry or large jewelry Because of that this is perfect for me to carry and travel with different sets of earrings and or one or two necklaces so that they dont touch each other and get tangled together So just a thought or another idea in case someones interested Its working for me maybe itll work for you Honestly it could be useful for other things too SoIf youre past your return time and you dont like it for vitamins and supplements get creative ladies , I travel on weekends and my old pill management system was essentially 4 different ziploc bags full of vitamins etc This pill case is perfect for storing your pills for a few days probably no longer than that depending on how many you take If the supplements you take are very large in size this case might not work for youThe quality of the case is better than something I would expect to find at a dollar store or a discount bog box store This is the first pill case Ive ever used so perhaps I have low standards  but I love the size 2L x 2W x 1D and the quality seems fine to me , Okay yes its 10 bucks but its fits all my meds and vitamins for on the go Before I was buying travel size pain killers but now I can just store them in this case , I love that its small but yet very compact  Its exactly what I needed and expected  This case is sturdy and feels very durable The compartments inside are perfect for sorting out whatever medication or vitamins you might need on the go  The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I feel like the lids of the compartments if used daily will eventually just break off at the point where they bend when opened they arent hinged  Other than that no complaints at all  I included pictures next to a Sephora concealer for size reference , VERY poorly made Will not withstand daily use Plastic is already warped upon receiving Item does not close Main closure does not snap closed just pops back open as in picture Also as you can see smaller compartments do not seal completely closed Even if you do get one thats ok I can see the way this is made the plasic will break or wear out with daily use Disappointed as design is cute , Great for the sniff sniff but tbh Read the description because I didnt Its really tinny , Its small but compact I fit everything I need in here The price is worth it , It is small but that is what I was looking for Its perfect to keep in my purse I just used on a getaway and it fit 2 days of pills for me and my husband Love it , Exactly what I was hoping for I needed something to hold pills in my purse especially something to keep them separate This is wonderful I enjoy how theres the larger section as that works perfectly to hold my migraine and allergy pill packets And then the smaller ones I use to separate my Advil Tylenol and Gravol This has saved so much room in my purse , As a person who is on regular meds this is perfect for my purse Its small but the compartments are big enough to hold enough medication for a while I honestly love it , I received this an actually liked the compactness of this case Its cute and can be tossed in your purse without being clunky Unfortunately this is going back because upon opening one of the compartments the plastic cracked and can no longer be closed This just shows it isnt very durable and Im glad I found this out within the return policy I wont be repurchasing , Comically tiny It fits maybe 2 days of my supplements so it makes no sense It great for a purse to cary advil or any pain killers or allergy medication but it is not good for longer travel or weekly planning , If youve been using pill cases for a while you kinda know what to expect for a certain price I dont understand the reviews about size for what this costs either way especially from Sephora It looks exactly as expected from the product photos but maybe thats because Ive had similar items in the past This is significantly better than other cases Ive bought for 10 I have ADHD among other things and take a few different meds throughout the day Ive bought cases like this on Amazon but they all broke easily the size was off or it felt too cheap so Ive been carrying little disposable pill pouches until I found this Price seems s pretty fair to me Its not super cheap glad I ignored the 2 sole negative reviews the plastic isnt flimsy and shiny it has a matte feel its sturdy and it doesnt seem like it will break easily in my backpack Similar cases on Amazon for the same price feel a bit cheaper or the plastic latch snaps and breaks easily The way this one snaps closed it much better and I like having the full compartment in the lid for travel If youre looking for a larger case with a weekly organizer theres a nice one at Nordstrom for about 20 with a mirror but for a small case to carry meds or supplements for the day and throw in your pocketbag Id say this is just fine I threw some random items near it and an alcohol prep pad in the lid for size comparison , A little cheaply made but it does the jobIt has a few compartments some are a bit hard to openI cant see it lasting too long if its going to be thrown in a purse or bag the cost could be lower , Perfect little case for traveling Its sturdy good quality stuffI am glad that I made this purchase , I have been getting some new symptoms when that time comes so I keep various pills in my bag just in case I was using an empty mini of an old pill bottle to store them all but if I wanted a specific pill I had to pour them all out This is perfect and exactly what I needed and I love the muted pink color I have plenty of space and no trouble opening and closing unlike other reviewers I will probably pick up another for myself or a gift , Exactly what I was looking for perfect size to throw in your purse Idk why so many people have issues with it Exactly what I was looking for , This case was smaller than I expected but i like that about it I have various travel pill cases with separate bottles so I liked that this case was set up as an all in one with 4 compartments Its definitely enough room for my to carry a weeks worth or so of vitamins Depending on the size of pills you plan to carry it might hold less I like its small size to toss into my purse or coat pocket and not take up much room You could also use it to carry other things like ear buds gum or mints Its versatile , I literally laughed when I opened my order today which included this Its TINY From the photo I thought I was getting a large case big enough to store bottles not a few individual pills Ill definitely be returning Its cute though Id give it 3 stars if Sephora actually listed the measurements on here , Its a little smaller than I expected basically 2 14 inches wide 1 14 thick but still will be useful for pills in my purse when traveling or for a mini jewelry box for some earrings The inside compartment lids seem like theyll stay shut until you want to open them Overall decent little travel pill box , Cute but poor quality and at that price Returned , I wasnt expecting amazing quality but it still seems cheaply made A couple of the compartments dont snap all the way shut unless you really put some force into closing them All of the hinges are cheap plastic that feel like theyll wear or loosen over time I bought this to carry a few essentials ie Advil Tums to stash in my bag every day so Im worried it wont hold up over time Overall this is ok for the price but wont be replacing once it breaks Too bad because all of the compartments make it super convenient , it is quite small and u may buy a similar one in dollar store got this returned , I always carry medication around in my purse and always resorted to tiny plastic bags because I could never find a case that was small enough This is exactly what I was looking for It has 4 different compartments that close tightly and hold quite a lot of pills The outside is sturdy and wont open easily in your bag , Its very small Cute and nice silicon type feel perfect for small bags Somewhat expensive for size , The case is cute but very small about 2 inches x 2 inches"
Targeted Anti-Aging Bakuchiol Serum,"Love the product its creamy soaks in nicely does smooth out my fine lines and doesnt pill over my other serumsmoisturizer Its also affordable and doesnt irritate my dermatitis at allHate the packaging terrible dropper like others have said It doesnt reach to the end of the bottle so you lose some product and its tough to see how much is left over If Saphora fixed the dropper or made a pump and larger version it would be chefs kiss , This serum is great I have noticed a big difference for fine lines and elasticity Only complaint is the dropper I see a lot other reviews say they would prefer a pump  I agree Also value size please , Ive been using this daily and definitely see evenness on my skin Tightening effect maybe not so much but its a great and harmless product for my skin Love clean Sephora products  , I was nervous to try it because of possible allergic reactions and Im glad I took the plunge My skin had been a bit lackluster and wasnt really responding to my current rotation so I went back to an old favorite and also incorporated this My face seems brighter and more balanced now so something about it must be amenable to my skin Im pleasedFour stars for the texture which is sort of strange thicker than I expected but does emulsify on the skin pretty well Id say this is a gentle nice introduction to this type of antiaging product and I like that it has about six ingredients rather than a billion random ones that might irritate my skin I cant use a lot of enzymes for example because Im allergic to the fruits that produce them so many popular bakuchiol products are out for meAlways patch test with new things inside of the wrist then the jaw I did so the night before I started to use this on my face  Nothing happened and I felt safer slathering it on , I was reading research on bakuchiol and its effectiveness is greatly reduced when it is exposed to air the packaging here doesnt make sense  everytime you use the dropper you expose the product inside to air and reduce its effectiveness please put this into a pump form instead of dropper , I used this product religiously for about a month It made my skin feel healthy and moisturized However I broke out everywhere I used it face and neck , Is it helping with my finelines Unclear Is it making my face feel pampered and moisturized Definitely The bottle lasts a good while so definitely worth the purchase And it doesnt aggravate my rosacea like retinols do , Today was the first time I used it I washed my face dried it  applied this serum and after it had been absorbed I put it on my face cream 20 minutes later my face started to feel itchy It broke me into hives , I was wanting to add something to my skincare routine to target wrinkles and this was a great addition I have very sensitive skin and I am able to use this with no reactions at all I have been using regularly for several weeks and while I have not noticed a huge improvement my forehead lines are definitely softer and I feel like the overall appearance of my face is smoother and firmer , On my third bottle I have rosacea and am prone to eczema This serum keeps my skin clear and youthful looking I apply it after inkey list azelaic acid and before Sephora daily face moisturizer Best routine for my sensitive red skin , Love the product but the dropper is super annoying Would love it if they made a pump lid instead I have very sensitive skin and this fit in perfectly with my routine without any harsh reactions , Ive been using this for about 3 weeks now and I love the way its made my skin look and feel I see reduced fine lines and my face is so soft As mentioned in other reviews the only problem is the dropper is not a good fit for the product it doesnt suck anything up so I just end up pouring it into my hand which is inconvenient , This a serum that didnt cause irritation and didnt present problems using alongside my prescription retinol or prior to vitamin c , I really like how this product absorbs into my skin I use it morning and night along with Niacinamide plus Zinc and Multipeptide plus HA both by The Ordinary This 1oz bottle has lasted me about a month with twice a day use I like it better than Herbivore for absorbency although it does have a chemical smell when applied Immediately after application I feel that my skin texture looks great In one month I have not seen any notable improvements in the fine lines around my mouth or eyes Im really torn about purchasing this again or trying something with 2 Bakuchiol I am very happy with this but what if theres something BETTER out there , Received out of the box bottle was sticky and dont know if theres supposed to be a seal on the bottle , Have been using this for at least seven weeks now and havent noticed any change at all , Very pleasantly surprised by the results Skin is smoother and brighter and my forehead and eye wrinkles have definitely diminished No irritation whatsoever Would recommend to anyone looking for a retinol alternative , Great affordable spot treatment for the whiteheads on my nose , Excellent product  I implore Sephora to not reformulate it any time soon I selected this particular bakuchiol because of its quality formulation and in practice it is indeed a light milky serum that is wonderful to use and already shows results in 15 weeks of using it By choice I only use it at night I am someone who was able to use prescription tretinion regularly up to a year at one pointbut hated how it left my skin feeling sensitive and reactive Overthecounter retinolretinal products also left my eyes feeling dry This Made in France bakuchiol serum has given me a similar rejuvenation bounce and glow as tretinoin but my skin barrier is also more reinforcedTo echo some other reviewers the only minor quibble I have is to improve the packagingmaybe switch to an airtight pump instead of the clumsy dropper It wont stop me from repurchasing and recommending this product to friends and family however , I was really disappointed with this serum I had high hopes based on prior good reviews Ive been using the product for a month and dont see any difference The dropper in the bottle is every poor and its very difficult to get the product out It has a strange consistency as well Was really hoping for a good affordable Sephora alternative to retinol  , The serum has no fragrance and it get absorbed in the skin very fast The texture is very nice as well snd not stickyI only gave it 4 stars because as many other reviews mention the dropper doesnt work well and you have to dip it several time to get enough product You also have no idea how much product is left in the bottle which can be frustrating , Its Really working for fine lines making skin smooth hydrating less expensive , This is a MUST HAVE serum I love it so much this serum is affordable compared to others on the market and it actually works This AntiAging Serum leaves my skin feeling tight and firming It also feels really soft on your skin and its easy to work with I always overuse all my products but with this a little goes a long way even though I still overuse the product lol I actually stopped using serums in general because I couldnt find one that felt like it was worth it but once I tried this I now cant stop using it in my skincare routine , Started using this nightly first trimester during pregnancy as a retinoid alternative and I feel like its helped achieve similar results paired with glycolic acid exfoliation some nights and keep my acne at bay I researched other bakuchiol products but so many of them dont say the percentage which is frustrating This serum is simple and with the recommended strength of bakuchiol to be effective Ive gotten some pregnancy glowing comments so Ill keep it in my nightly routine Ordering 2nd bottle , After using this product for the last week my skin has appeared more hydrated and less redness And the application wasnt greasy or sticky feeling  it absorbed really quickly it has become a favorite in my skincare routine , I noticed the other week that the fine lines in my face were noticeably less I definitely think it is because of this product  It is very reasonably priced and I see results The only reason for the 4 stars and not five is the packaging  The cap does not stay closed so I do not bring this with me on travel You have to use the dropper several times to get product out and the bottle is so dark you dont know how much product you have left  The smell is also just OK , Product is great However purchasing an item half empty is not cool , I definitely love this product Ive been using it for about two weeks and I can definitely tell a difference between the age in mind around my eyes they have diminished , I love this serum The last bakuchiol serum I used cost 3x as much and irritated my skin This serum is already working wonders My skin tone looks much more even and has reduced the typical redness I have My face and neck look healthier than just a couple weeks ago I cannot believe what a bargain this is Retinol is just too irritating for me and Im way too sensitive to the sun as it is Bakuchiol is the perfect alternative for me Please keep making this product , Im over 34 done my first bottle Its a great serum easily layers hydrating nonirritating and evensbrightens my skin Im on RetinA but might just stop as this is a great alternative What I dont like is the bottle The dropper doesnt form a tight seal every time I close it Like it undoes itself after screwing it back on The dropper also doesnt come close to reaching the bottom Currently Im having to do multiple suctions and angles to get enough serum Fix the bottle and this gets 5 stars , Great alternative to retinol  love that it doesnt make me more sensitive to the sun after use Ive noticed that my skin tone is a lot more even and Ive started to see a reduction in some fine lines I have on my forehead Ive been using for about a month and am really happy so far , I love this stuff only issue I have is that the bottle doesnt stay sealed properly when you close it Otherwise my skin feels amazing after using this and it is not oily , Im not necessarily hoping to look like a glazed donut here but this serum seriously dried up my skin I dont recommend it , WOW WOW WOW ET REWOW JADORE TOTALEMENT CE SRUM jai une peau  tendance acnique avec beaucoup de pores et ce srum a fait des miracles avec ma peau le prix est vraiment abordable bravo Sephora Jespre que ce produit sera disponible longtemps , I really like this stuff its got kindof a milky texture to it that feels really nice on the skin I wasnt familiar with the main ingredient when I first received the product but it does seem to make my skin feel really smooth and radiant Cant wait to see how it looks after a couple more weeks of use , Been wanting to try something for anti aging preferably serums so decided to give this a shot Well worth it because its veganclean and inexpensive which is usually what Im looking for I have sensitive skin and so far its been great , Love this So far I havent had much luck with retinols because of my dry skin I had heard that bakuchiol could be a decent alternative and this definitely doesnt exacerbate my dry skin at all No issues with purging either , I love when products work without being overly expensive The serum seeps into the skin pretty fast which is great because it lessens time spent on my morning skincare routine Would definitely recommend this , Its claiming Targeted AntiAging Serum which is very appealing for women over 50 I liked the fact its using 96 of ingredients from natural origin Its not only unscented but also doesnt have an unpleasant smell I like the smooth texture and works well with any moisturizer I hope to see more results in the long run , So good product definitely does not have to be expensive This serum while Ive only used a little definitely feels great on the skin Things you meed to know it smells great not too fragrant it absorbs fast so low maintenance girlies can join in and you will get more out of it if you are consistent and wear sunscreen , I love this Sephora targeted anti aging serum I use it twice a day and it never feels to heavy or sticky I also really like how its vegan cruelty free and its a quality skin product without the expensive price tag , THIS PRODUCT it had my skin looking the AMAZING I did not expect this outcome from this product OBSESSED Its a must try if you are looking for a great skincare item  Will for sure be repurchasing , I am glad to see an affordable antiaging serum as most alternatives are on the pricey side Pros include that it is vegan it is Clean at Sephora and comes in recyclable packaging Overall my first impression is that it is a good quality product without being expensive I am giving it four stars now because I havent seen results yet which isnt uncommon for this type of serum The ingredients especially Bakuchiol extracted from babchi seeds seem so interesting to me So far I havent noticed any breakouts or bad reactions from this so I am definitely going to keep using it and testing it out , This serum is really nice for people trying to start incorporating antiaging products into their daily routine The Sephora line has a lot of great options for beginners and is comparable to the ordinary or inkey list , Ive been trying out this serum for a couple weeks now and so far Im enjoying it The texture and packaging are great and I love that its vegan and Clean at Sephora also that its pretty affordable My skin actually feels pretty hydrated after using this which I didnt expect I havent noticed much change since using it but since its only been a couple weeks Im definitely going to keep using it to see the long term effects , I really liked this Even though Im in my 20s I want to start on my antiaging routine early This serum absorbed quickly into my skin and was easy to layer on top of my other skin care creams Absolutely love it and will continue using it in my skin care routine , I really liked this product Quality dont have to be expensive This product proves it on 100 I like that this product is vegan and has vitamin E I use it 2 times a day morning and evening on a dry face , This is such a good serum I am a big fan of sephora collection products The price is always right and the quality is always good This serum makes my skin feel so good and hydrated I havent had any redness or irritation with this serum I would continue to repurchase , My skin loves retinol so I wanted to see how it would react to this similar ingredient and it works for me really well too I like that theres an affordable option thats good quality hope to see more Sephora skincare in the future , A little hard to give a clear review on the true efficacy of this product considering Im in my 20s and antiaging is hard to gauge over a few weeks But I can say that this product is totally inoffensive in all the ways that matter smell texture etc the packaging is convenient to use and it mixes well with my night moisturizer At the very least it seems to be giving my skin a bit of a plump the next morning , Firstly I am in my 50s so I usually use high end skincare products This antiaging serum was just okay compared to what I usually use On the plus side its vegan and Clean at Sephora It goes on smoothly smells earthy and didnt irritate my eyes or skin I used it for over a week and it didnt work as well as my more expensive serum This might be good for someone younger who is preventing wrinkles and fine lines but someone who already has them it doesnt diminish them , Ive been looking for a serum and I finally found one that worked Quality doesnt mean expensive and for this price point this product is amazing And the best part is clean vegan product exactly what I am looking for in a serum , I received this product as a gift to review with my honest opinion I absolutely love the way my skin felt after using this product It left my skin hydrated all day long and not too oily just perfect mix , Really enjoyed this product i feel like it hydrated my skin very well it was easy to use and didnt splatter at all  A little went a long way When I woke up in the morning my skin felt soft and did not feel super oily I would purchase again , I usually use retinol at night but Ive been having some sensitive skin issues and figured bakuchiol might be a nice more gentle alternative This never aggravated my skin any more then it was  Its a very light formula that skins into the skin quickly yet is effective I think its a great alternative to retinol or retinal products if you have more sensitive skin  I also love that it is on the more affordable spectrum meaning you dont have to sacrifice money for good skincare , This product was given to me free I love sephora product and this one is close to my favorite I loved the way it made my skin feel and look I would buy this again for sure and would recommend it to many , What I love about this anti aging serum is that it really does make my fine lines look way smoother and my skin much firmer I have combination skin and it works well on mine without making it too oily or dry its has the right amount of moisture , Retinol is pretty harsh on my skin so I love that I can use this quality serum as a gentle substitute I was gifted this to try courtesy of Sephora The serum is smooth and vegan  which is always a plus , I love how my face felt after using it I have dry skin and since I started using it my skin feels hydrated during all day Also smells amazing Normally I used before doing my makeup and I noticed it looks better when I do use it , I received this product for free from Sephora and exchange for my honest review and I think this is an OK product This is really thin and texture and doesnt feel like anything on the skin and Ive noticed this to be true for most of their serums This is an antiaging serum so I dont expect it to hydrate But for those of you who dont layer different serums like I do this might be a problem for you I didnt see any improvement on the very fine lines on my forehead but I do think this product unfortunately broke me out along with the other ones from the Sephora collection that I have been trying in conjunction with it I dont think this works maybe in a more longterm use I could see more results but it was not the serum for me , Ive been enjoying this antiaging serum in my nighttime routine The texture feels lightweight  and fast absorbing It doesnt irritate my skin like other retinol products  Ive noticed positive changes in my skins texture and my skin looks smoother I look forward to continuing using it in my routine , I finally found an affordable antiaging serum I just turned 30 and I was looking to add an anti aging serum into my existing skincare routine but I wasnt ready to commit to a pricey brand just yet Im so glad I found this generous size bottle for such an affordable price The soft milky texture sits well mixed with my everyday moisturizer Its light and not at all sticky I love that its fragrance free and the clean vegan formula is a great bonus I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family , This serum is awesome Ive seen so many alternatives to it with the same ingredients with a much higher price tag The quality of this product is just as great while also being inexpensive A great option for a lightweight anti aging serum thats vegan clean and cruelty free , This product is not only affordable but after just 2 weeks of use I am already noticing a difference in my skin and neck This product is vegan and cruelty free which is very important to me I cant wait to see the progress my skin makes while I continue to use , I have 36 years old and I have fine lines around my eyes with the anti aging serum I see a lot of improvement definitely it is a great product to recommend I only being using the product for a week and I see a huge improvement , It is difficult to find Bakuchiol in Skincare products they are generally quite expensiveI loved this serum it is ultra light and absorbs quickly on my faceIt helps me a lot with my blackheads and the texture of my skin leaving it radiant and luminous , I havent noticed a great difference within a week of using this product I would like to think its making a difference because I enjoy the application process but Im not totally sold Maybe Ill update in a few more weeks , Really impressed by this product I was surprised at first by the color and consistency because it is a milky white color almost like a lotion and a little creamier than most serums Ive tried Applicationwise though it goes on smooth like a serum and soaks right in doesnt sit on the skin like a lotion would  This product makes my skin feel soft and supple and Im loving that its clean and vegan So important when it comes to our skin , I am always on the hunt for new skin care especially with anti aging I recently started to notice small aging signs and have been looking for products to help with first signs of aging around the eyes and forehead I see love that this serum is not only vegan and cruelty free but its so affordable Typically serums run over 50 so when I saw the price I knew I had to try all of Sephoras skin care collection that Ive tried is amazing I will say Im not a 100 sold on the texture of the serum its like a milky texture but I did feel a bit drying yet super hydrating at the same time so thats a plus I love that it layers well with other serums or facial creams , Personally Ive been really enjoying how this feels I dont find it to be irritating at all and I like the way my skin feels in the morning I really only use this at night time It makes my skin feel soft and look a bit radiant It hasnt dried out my skin either which I was kind of worried about with an anti aging specific product This is a great veganclean option , This product has been amazing to me My skin feels and looks taut and smooth I put this product after I shower then top it with a serum and thick moisturizer to seal it all in place Overall I highly recommend , This is another clean and vegan product from Sephora I really love their clean beauty line and own several products Bakuchiol is the new trend now and I like that it is plant derived I havent seen any longterm results yet but I will continue to use Texture is not sticky , This serum is literally the best and I have tried soooo many including ones that are over 60 and this serum literally feels like if you just put water on your face Its sooo lightweight and moisturizing If you dont like sticky serums this is for you I cant believe how affordable this serum is for its amazing quality , I really like the way this feels on my skin  is almost milky but feels like a gel that leaves my skin looking soft and feeling very firm Nonfragrant which is great for sensitive skin it has a clean smell definitely good to incorporate into my skincare routine on nights Im not using retinol or exfoliating , This vegan serum effectively reduces the appearance of wrinkles and lines It is formulated with 96 percent naturalorigin ingredients to visibly smooth and hydrate skinIt works for normal dry combination and oily skin type Use the dropper to apply three or four drops of the serum to clean dry face and neck I apply it every morning and evening to perfectly clean skin that has been cleansed of all visible impurities and makeupI love that this product is vegan and comes in recyclable packaging , Because I havent been using this long enough to see results on my skin I can only speak to the application experience This serum starts as an opaque milky white then spreads out like a clear gel It has a faint scent like a disinfectant wipe that dissipates on the skin It layers well doesnt pill and is comfortable to wear , I have been using this targeted anti aging serum for several weeks It has made a difference in my complexion so far with visible differences in how smooth my skin looks and how firm it feels It has helped my fine lines , I liked this serum to improve the appearance of the skin and give it more shine it has hints of sunflower that has antioxidant properties its smell is neutral and does not irritate my face it is not expensive and it is good of course it is not that it works miracles with the lines of expression but if it helps you a lot to give your face a fresh appearance you have to be constant , As we age a majority of u are looking for products that helps with aging and even though I just started using the product I have already seen some great improvement in my laugh lines Which is very helpful I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to add products for aging to their routine , Ive been using this product twice a day for about a week and a half now I feel like I need to use it a little bit longer to truly notice some change But I love the consistency that it gives It looks milky almost it goes on very smoothly Directions say to use on dry skin but I personally use while my face is slightly moist because I want it to soak into my skinI love that its vegan and CLEAN because Im always concerned about what product Im putting on my face And the price point is very reasonable You dont need to spend an outrageous about for quality products , I recently started trying to incorporate antiaging products into my skincare routine Although this serum came in unsealed packaging I really enjoyed it and it goes to show that quality doesnt have to be expensive After a week I feel like it helped cleared up some stress acne on my chin and cheeks , Ive been using this SEPHORA COLLECTIONTargeted AntiAging Bakuchiol Serum for about 2 weeks now I can see a little change in fine lineswrinkles around my eye and on my forehead My skin feels great Feels hydrated Im really liking this serum and cant wait to see the improvement over the weeks to come , So impressed with this product and love that its vegan and clean Absolutely loving this serum In the short time Ive been using it I can already tell a difference in my skin My skin feels softer more even toned and overall looks youthful My fine lines also look less defined too Quality does not have to be expensive The price point is awesome on this Lastly its very gentle and I was able to incorporate it every night with no irritation , I was sadly underwhelmed by this product I used it for a week and noticed that the serum dried out my skin I have combination skin particularly making dry areas of my skin even more noticeably drier I didnt see any benefits that stood out to me using this , I have a good connection with Sephora skincare products  I already have some of them and I think they are pretty good This product is not the exception It is good It is easy to apply It is not expensive However it doesnt work miracles You must to have a full skincare routine to get more results , This product is wonderful for targeting fine lines and wrinkles I really enjoy using it and thing its gentle to use at least 2xweek I think retinol and retinol alternatives are staples for anyones skincare routine , Ive been using this serum for about 3 weeks now mainly focusing on my eyes around my mouth and forehead area I have seen a difference in the fine lines  I also feel that it is very moisturizing and smoothing Love that I can get such a good quality product for an inexpensive price , A serum that targets wrinkles and lines for visibly smoother firmer skin and a more youthful appearance Is for Normal Dry Combination and Oily skin If youre worried about Fine Lines and Wrinkles Loss of Firmness and Elasticity this is your product to use It has a dropper to apply , This anti aging serum is great I have been using it twice a day and have been seeing my fine lines diminishing over the past couple weeks Im 23 but have fine lines and pre mature wrinkles and dry skin and its been helping my skin glow and flourish I was gifted this product by sephora , I love its consistency It is unscented and instantly absorbs into the skin It is very hydrating I have some fine lines around my forehead and I have noticed little difference It does wonders plus super affordable , Love the consistency of this Goes on nicely dries quickly Love the affordable price point and also that it is clean and vegan I like to follow up with a moisturizer after applying this Have been only using for a couple weeks but am excited to see the results , I love that this product is unscented and it feels great on my skin I dont have many fine lines but noticed my skin was more glowy I let my mom use it for a few days and she said her fine lines were much less noticeable Overall a good serum for the price , I love that Sephora has a great collection of affordable clean beauty This is a creamy serum that can applied day and night So far I have no complaints and cant wait to see the results after longer use , This product has definitely changed my skincare regimen Ive been needing anti aging skincare products to add to my skincare because Ive been noticing some fine lines on my forehead Ive used this for about a few days now and there are a few things I love about this product Firstly the texture is very milky and nice which I love because I know my face is hydrated Secondly this is a vegan and clean product and super inexpensive Thirdly this product does work Ive been seeing less fine lines on my forehead after a couple uses , Love this serum Its vegan and cruelty free and feels amazing on the skin I love that you get quality ingredients at an affordable price Ive been using this day and night for about a week and love it so far , I was gifted from Sephora collection This serum made my face look so perfect It smoothed a lot of my fine lines and mares my skin looks so glowy and no longer dull Its scentless and has amazing ingredients , I love the price on this serum I use it twice daily on my face and neck it sinks into my skin easily and I can see a difference already I cant wait to see what happens aft"
Targeted Dark Spots Serum,"Used the entire bottle with no to minimal results on sunspots , This created more breakouts and in turn more dark spots It literally did what it was supposed to correct Im very disappointed by this Its going right in the garbage , Im a lover of the Biossance  Vitamin C Serums but the price point is up there This Sephora Dark Spot Serum in my opinion is comparable with its performance with hyperpigmentation on darker complexions and it hasnt caused me any issues with my topical acne medications , I recently received this product from Sephora and have been testing it out for the last two weeks I love that the texture of the serum it goes on the skin very smoothly and layers well with my other serums No pilling Ive applied this on my hands and face I havent noticed much changes on my face yet but theres been some fading on my hands where the darkest spots I have are I will continue to use and hopefully see even more results in my face As mentioned this product was gifted but I will likely purchase in the future , I liked this product but I didnt love it Compared to other dark spot serums Ive used this is just average I dont think the formula is strong enough to notice a difference in my dark spots after just 10 days I will continue to use it and monitor my results I do think this is a good starter product for someone just starting their skincare routine who is looking for some long term benefits The price is very affordable for the quality and I appreciate that there is no added fragrance although it has a tiny bit of a natural herbal smell I loved seeing a clean and vegan brand at Sephora , Ive been using this serum for a few days now and can already tell it will be one of my favorites It feels so hydrating and plump on the skin as well as leaves my skin looking much brighter and healthier after using it Definitely will be something I repurchase , I love how this is vegan and clean from Sephora Great quality doest have to be expensive and I love how this serum makes my skin feel I am excited to start noticing results and hope this helps fade my dark spots left from acne  It feels very gentle on my skin and I would recommend this product to everyone , it was okay for a little its really hydrating but it made my fungal acne worse anti chunks up , I used this product everyday for about a month and a half I can definitely see the difference It fade my dark spots a lot and very very deep dark spots I had it reduced them a lot Will continue to used until its all gone and the price is great that was one of the best parts , Enjoy this product very much I love the smell and Ive seen actual results in the past few weeks , I dont see it lightening my sun spots or any other spots on my face but I will continue to use it cause I dont like to waste product , Not sticky or oily at all I noticed that my spots are lighter , A patch of dark spots came out on my forehead last year from being in direct sun and I would say theyve faded at least 5075 not very visible anymore Now if it was just from fading w time or the product I dont know But this is at a great price doesnt irritate my sensitive skin am on my 2nd bottle It has a great lights scent so be aware it is not fragrance free , Ive been using this serum in the evening and then layering with the Sephora collection BHA serum and find Im getting good results and its also very gentle and my skin is very sensitive , Really wanted this to work used daily for a month and didnt see any improvement Not buying again , It honestly doesnt work its like water with bubbles ive been using this product everday and i see zero difference keep in mind that ive used two bottles and yet no difference i have past acne scars that are both red and dark and random dark discoloration on my forhead and cheecks this helped with none of that , Works pretty well I have a dark spot near my eye and Ive noticed a significant reduction in the color since using this product for a couple of months It also makes my skin feel great , I love this serum it has helped me so much with acne in general Its helped reduce my old acne discolorations not a crazy amount but just enough where Im satisfied with my purchase Also Im breaking out a lot less My husband has an overall improvement in his face from using this twice a day I only use it once since I use a retinol at night , made my skin breakout badly also didnt see improvement with dark spots , I didnt see any difference in my dark spots been using it consistently for 2 months and zero difference , It didnt get rid of my dark spots it barely lightened it , Ive only been using this for a week so I cant say right now if it works well or not for dark spots because its just way too early to tell However this serum feels good on the skin its not sticky and doesnt leave my skin feeling dry out of oily My skin actually feels pretty soft and smooth I follow up with my moisturizer after putting this on Im going to continue using this for the next couple of months and track my progress I also like the fact that this is a natural product for a dark spot serum The ingredients are safe and natural , This stuff seems to be working My dark spots are really improving Usually my melasma only responds to Rx stuff but this is working So happy , I bought this June 3 and Ive been using it every if not every other day and I can say this product has helped my dark spots and scars so much already even my spouse noticed the difference in only a couple days and he never notices little things like that I am going to buy my second bottle very soon and I cant wait to see how my skin will look in a few more months , I ordered this in May so its been two months now and I must admit Im kind of shock Because I see a huge difference in my skin I have some dark spots on both my cheeks and chin and around my mouth I also have a new dark spot on my cheekbone thats already starting to fade That never happens I dont have acne anymore so now Im just focused on fading these dark spots I have And so far this is the best product Ive used to help fade dark marks Now I dont know if this is going to completely fade away all my darks spots But Im fully committed to this product now Ill post another review in the near future , I have very sensitive skin and I love this serum It feels very hydrating on the skin and leaves it plump and dewy I do see a bit of a difference in my dark spots but not a dramatic change Its affordable which is great so I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out , I got this product of the recommendation of a beauty advisor while picking up some other stuff Just finished the bottle and ordered a second I love itthe way it feels when going on afterwards my skin felt supple and smooth and I truly see improvement when using consistently aka I had some nights where I was too lazy for my routine and I could tell the difference lol Definitely would recommend , I feel like it really did work as my skin got clearer and I had a lot of dark spots However I dont know if its just me but it really dried out my skin I had to discontinue using this , I love worked so fast on my face and now my chins looks nice again , this serum came in a nicely sized bottle the dropper works well the serum smells nice and natural and best of all I did notice it lighten my dark spots , I have high hopes that this serum can help fade dark spots on my face from age and years of sun exposure I have only been using the product for almost 2 weeks religiously I like the texture it has no harsh smell at all and I use it 2x a day after cleaner and toner No noticeable difference as of yet but with continued use I remain hopeful , Its a nice light weight serum thats spreads beautifully across your face There is hardly any fragrance at all in this product It pretty much smells like strong tea After first use my skin had a nice glow to it After about 2 weeks I noticed my skin was softer and had more of a glow to it I can speak for long terms effect as I havent used it long enough to comment For the price point its worth the buy I will buy again when needed , It actually works guys but you do not see a big big difference Mind you I have dark skin so maybe thats why it takes more time And also no it doesnt smell bad And also theres fragrance in it Im very sensitive to fragrance but surprisingly I didnt get pimples from it Ill buy another one , The only thing that worked for me after trying soooo many expensive products , I have 37 year old aging skin and a Sephora rep suggested I buy this a few days ago The smell isnt bad for me at all its light weight and doesnt pill I use this after cleaning toning and using a hydraulic acid and layer other products without issues I am trying other products right now but I really feel like this is making my skin look like porcelain , Unfortunately Ill have to return this after a single use I like the texture and how it feels on the skin but the parfum scent is too much for me Its not a strong fragrance so if you are not bothered by parfum or even like it in your skincare then you can try it I cannot comment on its ability to help with spots since Ive only used it once but it seems like it could have potential based on the other ingredients Im disappointed that I wont be able to test it longer but I just could not tolerate the parfum"
Targeted Dark Spots Serum with Enzymes,"I dont believe this product works like it should , This is a great product especially at the reasonable price point  Really evened out my skin texture and tone Helpful for lighter areas of discoloration , So Ive been using this product for a month now and I can honestly say it works wonders Ive been using this alongside the Ole Henriksen Dark Spot Toner and The Ordinary Glycolic Acid Toner because my dark spots are pretty dark and theyre on different parts of my face and body This is lightweight and absorbs well into the skin Ive noticed a pretty significant difference in the discoloration of the spots and Ill be buying more of this as soon as I can Tip Use a small to mediumsized derma roller that has needles with this product to further absorb into the skin This tip allowed me to see results a bit faster even without incorporating my toners , I used the entire bottle and sadly did not see a difference in my skin I really gave this a try but maybe  I just have too much hyperpigmentation , I  was so happy to come across this product after trying so many other products for years for my dark marks I can say in less than the week I saw results I would definitely recommend this product  , The serum takes time to work it works after like two weeks its stung a little bit at first and left my skin feeling tight and kind of sticky but it did do what it meant to do I noticed the difference , Ive been using this dark spot serum for about a month now and I can actually see a difference I have tried so many products and this is the only one that has worked and it doesnt dry my face out It does smell a little weird but that only lasts a moment and then its gone Its definitely worth it , not sure its doing anything but I have not been regular because my under eye skin reacts badly to this so I have to be very careful applying this I am using it on my chin and jaw to get rid of marks I get from my monthly pimples but they have not faded yet using this for 2 monthsother than the questionable efficacy and my peculiar skin reacting to it this product is not bad has a good consistency no fragrance slightly moisturizing , This has made all the difference in my skin I have noticed my hyperpigmentation get visibly lighter my skin looks and feels smoother and brighter and even my acne is going down If you need another sign to buy this here it is , I see a slight lightening of my dark spots Nothing I have tried has made a change  except this , I have melasma due to hormones Premenopause Tried this stuff EVERY day in the ampm With in 3 days I saw a difference Ive used this stuff for over a month and half Spots are definitely less visible , This wasnt great for me My face stung and broke out almost immediately  Tried again the following day and it was worse so I wash it off and gave the bottle to my friend , Used the serum for more than two months twice a day my dark spots did not fade at all not even one bit Disappointed , Wow So many thingproducts I have tried guarantees 97  of women  such and such recommends etc and I see  nothing Zip No results I wind up tossing themMoney and time wasted Useless I have had prescription  skin lightening from a dermatologist that did not do anything much or the spots came back didnt really work This work So quickly Lately I saw a lot of brown spots upsetting as they seem to all come at once I retuned another most expensive product not purchase on Sephora this is amazing It works so quickly not month mere weeks Less than A miracle , Adult body acne and hormonal acne  this is the only serum Ive found that helps expedite the healing process and diminish the dark spots , On my second bottle now Love the formula because it hydrates the skin really well Ive had adult acne and Ive had a tough time with it This has certainly lightened it but the process is slow Thinking to get the third bottle too , I love the feeling on my skin I had only used for three days maybe in 2 weeks I will see results Always wear your sunscreen if you wear it during the day , It really works on my dark spots I finished my first bottle and I dont see any dark spots now Very happy with my purchase , I have post acne scarring that is really bad I did not notice a drastic change but I did notice some lightness of current dark marks Would I repurchase probably not Everyones skin is different so it could just be me , Dont sleep on this serum Ive tried all kinds of skin care products and spent a small fortune only to find the most effective serum for my acnedark spots was to be found in a 20 Sephora brand serum Literally had a significant noticeable improvement in my dark spots within a week , Product did absolutely nothing to my skin And when I say absolutely nothing I mean ABSOLUTELY NOTHING Dont waste your money , I love this product I have noticed that it has helped my dark spots on my skin I usually use it on my face for my acne scars or on my bikini line Sometimes on my under arms as well I really love how its vegan and clean as well It doesnt break the bank either so thats great My favorite part is that is fragrance free so it doesnt irritate my skin , Ive been using this serum for 2 weeks now and my skin feels brighter not sure about lightening if dark spots yet It sinks into skin right away and sits well under makeup so I can apply it in the morning before my makeup routine Its cruelty free and vegan so thats a plus always , I have a lot of sun damage around my temples that Ive been self conscious about for a while now and Im glad I was able to get my hands on this product Ive been using it for about 2 weeks now and Ive already noticed my dark spots have gotten lighter I cant wait to continue the use of this product and hopefully completely make my dark spots disappear I also love that its vegan and clean quality doesnt have to be expensive  , I have been incorporated this serum into my morning and evening routine for 2 weeks I like how it made my skin feel I applied it after my toner and before my moisturizer I notice some of my dark spots did lightening up a little bit obviously I will have to use longer to see any long lasting effects but I will definitely keep purchasing and my skin is loving it so far , I just started using this product but so far it feels super smooth on the skin and its not super runny which I personally like compared to other serums that literally feel like water Since its not runny a little definitely goes a long way The best part is that its cruelty free and vegan so thats a win , I really enjoy using this dark spots serum I didnt expect it to work as well as it did Overtime the dark spot on my face started disappearing Best of all is the affordable price Quality doesnt have to be expensive , This serum by Sephora is probably one my FAVORITE product from this brand You pay a good price for an amazing product The presentation is so neat and give you the results you need in just days I totally recommend it Use it in the evening and dont forget to apply sunscreen during the day , I really loved this product I didnt expect it to work as well as it did After a couple weeks of use I noticed my skin was lighter more even Just became my favorite I love that it has clean ingredients and its very affordable , This serum was very effective in reducing my dark spots and hyperpigmentation from my acne scars In a few weeks it really made a difference My spots are noticeably lighter It has a nice milky consistency that feels smooth on the skin I feel a little tingle whenever I use it but its not too strong just makes me feel like its those enzymes working , When it comes to skin care quality doesnt always have to be super expensive Sephora collection makeup is one of my goto for brushescosmetics and Im so glad I decided to try out this serum in their skin care line Over the past few weeks it has def help my acne marks diminish Im excited to try other products on this line , I usually never try or purchase Sephora brands because i dont see much reviews However I was sent this item and was in need of a brightening product for my eye bags I used it under my eyes and over my pimples and they dark spots did lighten up  i also love how its a vegan and clean and how Sephora is coming out with better products for our skin Its a reasonable price so you should get it and try it out , Its really works to my skin Little by little the dark spot in my face its disappeared I love the product ingredients that say its natural ingredients I will

amazing its not too thick or thin it doesnt feel sticky on the skin My skin doesnt feel irritated after using this serum For the price point this is an amazing product I will repurchase , I typically dont think many of these dark stop removal make that much of a difference  but this one does It is so comfortable to use it caused zero irritation and sank into my skin relative fast I love that it is unscented I dislike heavily scented skincare This one feels so lightweight and truly I notice some lightening I love that Sephora has come out with their own more affordable skincare line since as they say quality does not have to be expensive , This is probably my favorite new product I love that within a week I saw a huge difference in the darkness of my dark spots on my face In the darkness

well under makeup The serum is gentle on my skin It doesnt feel abrasive Looking forward to seeing my results , I have only used this for about two weeks so cant say Ive seen a drastic improvement in dark spots There is some evening out of skin tone What I really like about this is that it is also hydrating so I can skip a step in my routine I have pretty dehydrated and dry skin so exfoliating products can make it worse this helps keep the skin plump It hasnt irritated my skin and layers well with all my skincare and makeup There isnt any weird balling up or texture issues Im hoping to see better results with continued use , The dark spot serum is so hydrating while working to heal scars and blemishes Layers well with other serums and moisturizers A little goes a long way I will continue using the serum for ultimate results , Works  I had some stubborn dark spot after having adult acne  It was so difficult to get rid off them until I started using this product I totally can see better results The dark spots are still there but definitely clear Only a week using it and I saw great results My skin is sensitive and I have not had any problems while using this product , So far so good Ive noticed this product has made my skin brighter and softer the next morning I dont see a drastic reduction in dark spots in the two weeks Ive had it but my skin definitely looks and feels better , I love this dark spot serum from Sephora collection I love even more that it is vegan and Clean at Sephora This serum is such good quality and Ive only used it for a couple weeks and Im already noticing a difference in my skin , Wow This serum is simply amazing This formula really helped me with my uneven skin tone I could see an improvement just a few days after I started using this product Best of all is the affordable price Quality doesnt have to be expensive , So I have really liked this product but Ive only been using it a couple of weeks so I havent seen any real results yet It does work well to hydrate and plump my skin though and I have noticed my skin looks healthier and moisturized since using it For the price  its well worth it for those points alone I will continue to use though to see if theres any major difference with the dark spots and updaterereview , I love how it feels Its very moisturizing as well Ive been using it on my knees and hyperpigmentation areas for a week now and Ive noticed better hydration in the areas Not as dry and dark as before Id definitely have to continue using to see actual results , Ive been struggling with dark spots after having my child and using this dark spot serum from Sephora helped me a little to fade away those spots And the great thing about this product is vegan and clean at Sephora , I got this product to see if I

photos yet but Im excited to keep using it and see if I get good results , I am always looking for serums dedicated to dark spots given the fact that acne left me with severals acne marks and this serum is actually good it melts on the skin and it is not heavy I have seen improvements on my skin so far , This dark spot corrector feels really nice I love the dropper application The serum feels nice a cool when it touches my skin and it absorbs quickly without any sticky feel Ive only used this for a week and can see a slight difference but am definitely going to give it a month for full results , I have dark spots on my cheeks chin and forehead so I really like using this serum as a last step in my night routine I havent noticed a difference yet since Ive only been using this for a week but it is really moisturizing and doesnt make me breakout like a lot of products do plus its a good price Excited to see the results over time , This product has changed my skin literally overnight I noticed a difference in just one use and am super impressed as Ive continued using it My dark spots and hyperpigmentation are looking so much better thanks to this product , okay so i have this one really dark spot on my cheek from sun damage and i was looking for a product that would help it go away i tried this serum and i am so happy with the results so far it has dramatically faded my dark patch and i cannot wait to see how how my patch will look with future uses so so happy , I did receive this product for free and I think I am really seeing a difference in the hyperpigmentation of my skin Im so excited to see how it continues to work and if it will take scaring away completely , Been using this for little over a week Not seeing much process in diminishing my dark spot but i do love the feel of this serum It melts in the skin wonderfully and doesnt feel sticky or heavy Also loving the easy dropper application for my speedy morning skin care routine Will continue to use this with hopes it helping to fade my acne scars , As someone whos dealt with hyperpigmentation and eczema all my life This is definitely a lifesaver Ive noticed a change with the first month of using it I will continue to buy this product as long as you guys continue to make it , The serum is unscented not oily gentle and absorbs quickly into skin Plus I dont have to put a lot on my skin because it spreads so easily I like applying the serum every morning and evening on my face and neck After a week of using it I can tell that it really helps to even out my complexion and

appear to be a bit less visible too I also love to opt for clean vegan products whenever I can and this one has become one of my new favorites , I am obsessed with this lore reducing serum I have seen a significant difference in the texture of my skin since using it and would highly recommend Its also super affordable for all budgets you need this , I have to say that I have not used it much because I do not suffer from many spots on my skin but what I have used I have liked a lot because I feel that my skin has accepted it very well and it looks much better also for people who have many brands is a slower Prosecco but you will surely see results I highly recommend it , I really enjoyed this product It hydrates extremely well I was surprised at how well a few little drops actually went all over my face It was not sticky at all I thought it would be the direct opposite But it was great I would purchase again , The best inexpensive and vegan Bha and pha serum I have ever used My skin felt great supple soft to the touch and also very well hydrated Ive been using it for a week now and I am obsessed What are my favorite vegan products to date , I love this product worked great for me It was free to me It made my face feel very nice and refreshing I didnt notice a difference on my skin to it seemed way more moisturized and glowy Would buy this again , I really liked this product This was my first time trying a serum for pores like this I feel like it has definitely helped the ones on my nose and cheeks the most I use it after my skin care routine , So far so good Always do a patch test on the back of your hand first The consistency of this is soft and silky It has so far helped in managing my oilycombo skin I love the high percentage of active ingredients Seems like that really helps target the pores Also I love that Sephora skincare is clean and vegan , Trying to target all my skincare needs can get pretty pricey thats why I was excited to find this vegan serum for my pores to be an amazing addition to my routine but at a fraction of the cost I was gifted this to try courtesy of Sephora , this is a vegan and clean product it is clinically tested for combination and oily skin it has been found that after the first application it mattifies the pores they look cleaner and smaller and a smooth skin texture is felt It is an economical product that you find in sephora I highly recommend it , So far Im absolutely loving this It has the similar effects of a facial primer but without the feeling and consequences of blocking up pores No issues with breakouts super clean ingredients which is a plus and I noticed a difference almost instantly after application , The Targeted Pore Serum is giving me real results I have large pores and usually can squeeze debris out of them Since using this my pores have been clear and smaller in appearance Im usually a little apprehensive regarding pore products but this one really did workI also like that I can find a product like this without having to spend tons of money , I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion and it wasnt the best It was way thinner than my favorite serums and it didnt do anything for my pores It was also too watery for my taste and didnt feel like there was anything on my face even after generous application I used this in combination with some other Sephora brand skincare I received and was very underwhelmed , I love how it is not greasy or heavy on my face It did not create more issues like pimples or white heads and that is a super plus on top of it being clean and vegan Its not expensive so it allows me to restock with worrying about that , I have always had issue with my pores they are very large and this has helped me a lot It really helps me out and for a low cost which I really appreciate I love using this product and cant wait to see how it helps my skin in the long term , I am loving this serum There so many alternatives out there with the same ingredients that are so much more expensive The quality of this product is just as great while also being inexpensive After using it consistently my skin feels so smooth and my pores appear much smaller A must have if youre looking for a serum thats vegan clean and cruelty free , Quality doesnt have t"
Targeted Wrinkle Serum,"Great product I noticed results within the first week Was skeptical to try a Sephora brand skincare product but this was a great product to add to my AMPM skincare routine , I have menopausal acne and this works on it  keeps it from flaking off while healing it at the same time NO IDEA why it is so good for the acne but it is also food for the UPC lines around my mouth MY NEW FAVOURITE PRODUCT , Amazing results I cant use retinol but this does the same thing without the horrible skin irritation , I noticed small results after 1 use and hope to see more really nice product , My mother loves this product I have seen amazing result with her fine lines has visibly reduced Have been using for last 6 month with 3 bottles down so far , I use this serum morning and night after toner It has a milklike texture that absorbs nicely without being sticky Its gentle and feels comfortable on the skin Ive been using it for about two weeks and I feel like my skin looks firmer and healthier I also like that its unscented and the glass bottle is recyclable I will continue using this product , Bought this product about 2 months ago really enjoy the consistency of product its kind of milky It absorbs into the skin very wellOnly thing is I havent noticed a huge difference in the lines on my face I almost feel they could be more noticeableUsed this product in both AMPM , I bought this because I cant use Retinol but want similar results Including improvement in pores and mild acne I was pleasantly surprised at the texture unlike anything Id used before Its a thick milklike texture more reminiscent of a runny lotion though it applies and absorbs like a dreamI applied for the first time in the middle of a horrible cold which had left my skin depleted and fragile so I was amazed at just how moisturized and nourished my skin felt immediately upon application   Im no stranger to moisturizers Its just a treat to work with like skinlove in a bottle and so gentle that I can easily layer it with other actives If anything it seems to reverse any potential irritationMy current PM routine is Glycolic Acid Toner Salicylic Acid and this In the AM I apply w Hyaluronic Acid Vitamin C and SPF  a perfect base for makeup No pilling Even on top of multiple serumsproducts And while its fragrance free there is a SLIGHT powdery scent to it  which is typical of Bakuchiol Dont let its gentleness deceive  its effective as well Though Ive only been using it for two weeks Ive noticed an immense improvement in my skins texture tone and even fine lines I wasnt too sure how effective it had been targeting the latter until I reviewed Before photos The proof is in the pics Ive not yet noticed an improvement in my pores or sebaceous filaments though Ive noticed a great improvement in the texture of my pores In all this has become my favourite product to use  if only because its so versatile nourishing and easy to incorporate into an extensive routine My only gripe would be the packaging  which feels flimsy compared to the heavy quality of the bottle itself Which did come full FYI Id say if youre on the hunt for a Retinol alternative or even if your skin just needs a dose of TLC  look no further This will do the trick  your skin will thank you , I was recommended this product by a staff member when I came in asking about retinol I wanted to start and wasnt sure which one Being a newbie I was advised to start my sensitive skin on this prior to a full retinol use Great advice My skin gobbled up the Bak in a positive feeling refreshed daily look sort of way No reaction no smell no residual tacky or dry feeling post use Ive now moved to a retinol but recommended this to friends first trying out too , I havent noticed any noticeable change in wrinkles But can use it as a moisturizing one here and there , I never write reviews but Please keep this forever Sephora My skin looks amazing now thanks to your product , I am a huge brand person  but Id figured I would give it a try  Am I glad I did This product is amazing  It goes on so smoothly not greasy at all and absorbs quickly into your skin   I highly recommend for the 50 and older person Everyones been complimenting on my skin and Ive been asked twice if i had any work done Run dont walk , It makes my skin feel and look great Its a good introduction to retinol I gave it 4 stars because the bottle is half empty , The bottle I received was half empty Not sure if the packing is like that or something is wrong with the bottle I receive I tried using this for a week and felt like it has enlarged my pours near the nose area Lines on forehead are more visible than before , This product did not irritate my skin and did not create any breakouts Very nice lightweight serum with little to no scent The only downfall is how fast you go through the product but I use it morning and night as it allows for To extend use only use once a night Perfect for sensitive skin Will be purchasing another bottle , I cant speak for the effectiveness of this product just yet but I know it is making my skin feel much softer and my makeup sits nicely on my skin and not into my fine lines in the morning I havent changed any other products so I assume this is doing that Love it Will repurchase , I got this as a retinol alternative and I really like this serum Im currently purchasing my third bottle and have liked what its done so far My skin is a lot softer more hydrated and smooth I cant really speak for its effect on wrinkles as I dont really have any Ive been using this to help prevent them but I really do like this serum and feel it has helped overall Only down side is I go through it pretty quickly , Havent seen any differencebut it feels great on the skin I think it is a good moisturizer so apply it 2x a day , This product is white liquidy I slather a lot on my face focusing on my forehead neck laugh lines and besides my eyes I feel like my skin is firmer and plump Im in my 30s Asian have combo skin and have not broke out The value is great I felt like I had more results than my Costco firming serum and body shop firming serum , I dont normally write reviews but I had to for this I love it Im nervous about using retinol  this is a great alternative My skin is fairly sensitive redness and noticed no adverse reactions My skin looks less puffy and tighter in areas of concern Ive used the entire product and will repurchase every time , I love this stuff so much I can not use retinol because my skin is too sensitive to it This is a great alternative , Nice value and quality Milky and smooth serum mixes nicely wother serums used , Ive been using this serum consistently and I dont see any visible changesThe consistency is very thin with a milk like appearance It dissolves into skin easily enough just kept hoping I saw any improvement with my lines around my eyesIm going back to the gold standard Este Lauder It costs a lot more but I saw resultsIn my opinion dont waste your money , I have been using this serum for almost 2 months now and its been great with my sensitive dry skin Its a milky thin formula that dries very quickly and its not sticky , I was looking for a bakuchiol serum after using pads from the drugstore for a while and this one didnt disappoint its a more gentle retinol and I love it so far Fairly priced and I will repurchase , Very nice The product is light weight and non sticky  I dont have many lines but I think using it as a preventative will definitely help in the long run I didnt want something super aggressive in the antiaging category I think I found what I was looking for I love that it is CLEAN too , Already loving this serum Its white has a milky texture and after using it I can feel my skin tightening and theres a visible difference in the ol forehead lines Excited to see the results after a full month of use and love that it can be used day and night without added photosensitivity Dont forget your neck and decollete , Ive only tried it 2 days now so I dont have results in wrinkles but I wanted to review this as there arent any reviews yet It feels silky smooth when applied and seeps in very quickly Skin feels tighter and smooth after only 5 minutes It doesnt have any scent and its a bit watery The dropper is not great but for the price Im quite happy with the product Havent broken out yet"
The Clarifying Kit,"All three products are great but I have very oily skin and this moisturizer has taken all the grease away in ONE USE Hydrated radiant and no oil to blot off I have tried literally everything and nothing works this well You have a winner here , Great product n I have sensitive skin You must try the sample to enjoy it This is my second purchase , Really thankful I found this Works wonders Would recommend x100 , Super recommended skin feels so soft and hydrated , Great product overall has really cleared my skin The only complaint I have is that everything is a lot small than I expected But beside that I love it , The gel face wash is nice and light and lathers effortlessly The facial scrub is a bit thinner than I expected but gives a nice gentle scrub and smells AMAZING The moisturizer left my skin felling good , All 3 of these products are amazing The cleanser has a very rosy scent that I personally love If youre scentaverse I wouldnt recommend this The lather is just perfect  a Clear gel that suds just enough to not feel too much or too little Once I wash it off my combo skin feels clean but not crazy tight or anything The moisturizer is truly a matter moisturizer Theres no shine or grease but you can feel the moisture in your skin instantly The exfoliator is incredibly  a pea size goes a huge way the scrub is very tangible but not painful Has a slight smell as well but nothing I mind personallyI would buy this repeatedly but the tiny size of the moisturizer and exfoliator is a little off putting Its still an amazing set for the price though and Ive bought the face wash individually a couple times now As for clarifying it does a pretty good job I dont have major acne so I didnt notice a huge change but I could feel the cleaning and exfoliation at work each time , You need to get The best facial wash Rinses clean great for my combo to oily skin It looks glowy  ready to prime Te extras included worked really well A definite repurchase in full sizes , great gift for my aunts and mom I love sephora brand and find it comparable to drunk elephant , My current go to skincare products The cleanser works wonders at cleaning and toning skin the scrub exfoliates beautifully and the moisturizer is very soothing and hydrating This trio combo makes my skin the smoothest its ever been Love these products , Love this Price is great and lasts awhile plus is wonderful on my really sensitive skin Not drying , I bought this during the sale to try it out and I absolutely love the kit My face feels clean and soft Great for daily use Would recommend for anyone that wants to try a cleanser kit on a budget , This is a great kit I love the cleanser its light and gentle and feels great on the skin Reminds me of the Fresh soy cleanser The scent is overpowering especially for a more natural product The volcanic scrub is great a gentle scrub I would not buy this product on its own because it smells like an old mans cologne I wish I was joking However it did leave me skin silky smooth Overall great kit but fragrance is a bit much Cleanser is on repeat and will def buy again , I love how clear my skin gets but if I miss a day I breakout I also love how clean my skin feels after , AMA cleanser and volc scrub are amazing  best moisturizer for oily skin , It was a nice product and I liked how the cleanser was a toner as well but it just didnt work for my skin , I got this product as a sample fell in love with it my oldest daughter has very good at me she charge proactive and it did not work I bought her one for Christmas and the results are phenomenal absolutely love , I love this set so much it has worked wonders for my skin The cleanser leaves my face feeling fresh and clean and isnt stripping at all The scrub is a hybrid between a mud mask and a scrub and it makes my skin so clear The moisturizer is matte and oil free but still keeps my skin moisturized all day Overall this set has an amazing value , The product gets 4 stars based on packaging and ingredients The scrub is amazing and just the right amount of grit Absolutely could do WITHOUT the fragrance Its overpowering and too masculine The face wash is good but doesnt completely removed my mascaranonwaterproof but leaves the skin feeling smooth and clean The moisturizer is also nice but as mentioned it is a heavy cream Use sparingly massage into your fingers and pat into the skin All in all its good product for the price but they really need to get rid of that fragrance , The volcanic scrub is amazing I really wish I could buy a full version of that product , Dhabitude jabandonne trs vite  prendre soin de ma peau mettre de la crme etc mais je suis vraiment accros  cette crme matt  Ca rend tellement la peau douce C est malade Le gommage est juste tellement agrable  appliquer il a des petites billes  , Would be better minus the fragrance but my 13 year old niece enjoys this kit Shes been struggling with blemishes from breakouts , the best kit very nice it lasted me 5 months that almost 50 dollars a year for beautiful skin , Cleanser works as a basis but generally is mediocre Also includes fragrance so not the best 710The matte moisturizer is fairly heavy so acneprone beware The matte powder works but its not substantial 610The scrub is way too coarse and harsh The amount they give you is ridiculous so I would skip it I would recommend chemical exfoliation not scrubs Works fine for what it is 210The kit itself is fairly priced but I would say do your research and get products individually thats suited to your skin Overall 6510oilynormal combo skin acne prone , I noticed results within the first 2 weeks of using these products Dark marks from adult acne started to clear up I will definitely continue using , this cleanser made me break out in multiple areas and the moisturizer dried my skin out within minutes , The cleanser works well and does not dry out my skin The scrub does not feel harsh on my sensitive skin but I used it twice a week The moisturizer works well on my oily Tzone making it matte and controlling oil I am pleased with this set Cleanser is full size the rest travel , Im only here to reorder this product immediately to be stocked up This set is so worth it The star is the matte moisturizer It is an incredible primer for your makeup and keeps oil at bay I wait tables  bartend my makeup stayed fresh through a whole shift Im sincerely impressed The face wash  exfoliating wash are just as good , I love this brand from the all natural products to the natural materials used to package Im absolutely in love with the exfoliator , So much value for the money with this bundle I love the scrub especially and the mattifying moisturizer smells great , ordered this because I had tried every acne cleanser and thought why not try something more natural and you cant beat the price after once use my skin is soft not greasy and my blemishes are calmed down deff would recommend , Awesome kit Would 210 recommend works amazing would recommend for women Would use moisturizer after , 27 Bucks for all 3 is a STEAL The cleanser is mediocre but simple and still gets the job done Great to use as a first cleanse if you double cleanse like myself Moisturizer product sent from the heavens if youre naturally oily not too sure how it pairs with a full makeup face thoughExfoliater really brightens your complexion and makes you look radiant and gives face more elasticity"
The Hydrating Kit,"I buy this for the face wash The other two products are the bomb but wouldnt ever buy them on their own THE FACEWASH on the other hand is exceptional Can you please sell it separately again Please  , love this cleanser so so much pleasee bring it back in stores individually outside of the kits  feels like the fresh face wash without the rose smell , i used this product as a gift my friends were super happy with the results  , Love this product I have very dry skin and feel this works wonders , These products are great  I have sensitive dry skin and allergies and have had zero issues The natural scent is due largely to the rose oil content and is very light although probably not for everyone  I would like to buy the products individually in larger sizes , i got a similar set for the holidays pic liked the face wash so much i bought the hydrating kit to try pretty nice and light feeling , I was so excited to try these products and the face wash is amazing and works for my face it smells so good very similar to the fresh soy face wash I love the gel and how it foams up it feels SO luxurious However the day cream broke me out which I checked the ingredients and it is not good But the night mask shouldnt have broke me out but it still did I was so sad But I just have extremely sensitive skin so this would prob work for anyone elses skin The face wash is amazing though and a great value so I will repurchase the face wash but not the small cream and mask So one hit and two misses But keep in mind higher end products still have these odds for me at least , The overnight glow mask is the best product It does more for my skin than any of my more expensive overnight masks and exfoliaters I wish they would sell it separately and in a huge size , I LOVE the overnight glow mask so sad they dont sell it separately but altogether these products work wonders I have very very sensitive skin and they were not too strong for me my skin felt so soft the next day I took off a star because I have to buy this kit again to get the overnight glow mask but its well worth it plus you dont need to use alot so although its a small amount itll last awhile A must have , This was one of my first purchases Ive made in trying to create a Skin Care Routine for myself Ive tried a lot of other products but I keep coming back to this It is the only one that keeps me hydrated and does not leave my skin dry and flakey The price of these products does not reflect the ability on how good it works And sometimes less really is more , The scent is overwhelming Would NOT recommend to those that are sensitive to smells or are looking for scentfree products I will not be repurchasing this kit , Buying a second time because I love these products the glow mask and cleanser are my absolute favourite SC products  They are gentle and soothing and I love the glow and cleaning feeling , I LOVE the cleanser and the night cream The daytime moisturizer is good too but im just not a huge fan of the consistency It made my skin look amazing though , Excellent products the entire lineupI have spent 1000 on skincare in my life and liked this set better than most brand names The cleanser feels gentle and very slippery with minimal lather and slides around on my skin like silk The sleeping mask gives my skin a glow similar to what I would get after a facial and the moisturizer is INCREDIBLE At each step I massaged the product into my skin for 1 minute and was left with soft supple results I was pleasantly surprised by Sephoras skincare quality and bought 2 more sets Good for dry and dull skin like mine Affordable yet effective for me PLEASE DONT DISCONTINUE THIS SET , After reading a few reviews I decided to try this especially since its a clean product  Everything in the set was really nice but not as hydrating as I thought it would be Great for younger folk who dont need as much moisture as this old gal , This is my second time purchasing the Cleaner  Toner and is the main reason why I purchased this set I used it in the shower and is one of the few cleansers that takes the rest of my makeup that my makeup wipe didnt get Still great even on days that I dont wear makeup My skin feels clean without being drying and brighter The glow mask is okay Slightly sticky feeling used it a handful of times but have yet to notice anything different The moisturizer is heavy and although it is moisturizing I would not purchase it on its own It will come in handy on those winter months , Im enjoying the cleanser very much It has a gel almost jellylike consistency and lathers well The scent is mild and refreshing Ive used several highend products and this could easily pass for an 80 cleanser if fancily repackaged I think cosmetics are like wine  most people perceive taste as being better if they think the bottle is expensive PS its made in FranceThe included sample sizes are a great for travel If youre not struggling w pores like I am the mask wont be necessary just send it to me since the full size is out of stock atm lolThe moisturizer is good for day wear It also has a light scent and absorbs nicely Thats the only product Im on the fence about repurchasing simply because I have several fullsize moisturizers lined up for use maybe down the road , I havent bought this kit but I have and use all three products The cleanser is a foaming gel I use the glycolic acid 2x a week after cleansing and always at night before applying moisturizer I have combination oilydry skin and these products have been a lifesaver Im glad to see them in a set"
Ultra Glow Mask with Vitamins C + E,"Sephoras skin care line is very high end vibes  I love this mask and it didnt break me out and my skin looks flawless when I wake up I absolutely love this whole line even more than the top brands please dont change this , Amazing product Regular use of this has my skin glowing and dark spots fading I leave on for longer than 15 minutes when I have the time Its very cooling on the face , bon mais pas plus je l ai assayer comme ecrits je crois que je l aime plus pour la nuit , Ive been rotating this mask into my skincare routine for the last few weeks and have been pretty impressed withits performance and result and based on my experience am sharing my honest and authentic opinion of it as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community AmbassadorThis unscented gelcream feels light when spread across the face but theres also enough richness to the consistency that my skin feels it is being nourished Theres a slight apricot hue to the product in the tub but the tint is undetectable when the product is applied to skin My drier leaning skin absorbs the product with ease and feels lightly moisturizing theres the slightest bit of tack that very quickly dissipatesUsed as an overnight mask my skin feels soft and smooth the next morning It looks refreshed and brightened as well Over time thisbrighteningeffect takes on more radiance as the product with regular use reduces the appearance of darker spotsIve also used this product as a daytime moisturizer in a pinch and it has performed well to hydrate and moisturize my skin and also to prep and prime it for makeup , this mask does make your skin glow but when reading the directions i had used it as a quick mask and not overnight it implies to apply a thick layer and use a cotton pad to remove while removing the mask for the most part it did come off easily but some areas the product rolled onto itself making it a hassle to remove ended up having to use a wet cotton pad and came off a lot easier will have to try as an overnight mask and may not see this issue the product alone does a good job feels super refreshing and does help your skin glow , Great mask I really like this mask Used at night and my skin really glowed all day the next day"
Ultra Glow Serum: Glow + Strengthen Vitamin C Serum,"Soy Latina mi piel es seca y este serum me encant trajo vida a mi piel 100 recomendado , This is one of my favourite skin care product from Sephora After using this my skin looks so glowy and it also removes my scars , I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion I didnt notice any major differences but it did help hydrate my skin before applying moisturizer It was a travel size I received so maybe I need to buy another bottle and use longer to get the full benefit , The product overall is alright In terms of the texture and application is easy and feels good however I am not really sure if there was much of an effect on my skin It does not irritate my skin which is a plus for sure It could be that I was already using a vit c product before so that may be why I did not see much do a difference At the end of the day it is not an expensive product and did not bother my skin so I might replace some of my vit c products with this Note I did receive this product from Influenster to trial , Disappointed Didnt help at all My dark spots are back , I love this serum After using this product Ive seen noticeable improvements in my skin It has definitely brightened my skin giving it a nice glow and is more smooth WILL BE PURCHASING AGAIN , Great product to use on daily basis Would definitely recommend , I received this product as a sample and really enjoyed it I havent finished it yet but I would purchase it It helps so much in the winter with my dry skin I would love if it had a scent but I couldnt really tell that it had a smell , love it and it leaves skin feeling moisturized and I will buy again , I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review I thought this serum was alright I didnt notice any major differences but it did help hydrate my skin before applying moisturizer so thats a plus , This did brighten my skin extremely well however be careful as this product does have retinol in the ingredients list I have rosacea on my cheeks and have been using Vitamin C for a bit and noticed that I was experiencing some irritation on my face This is the only product that changed in my routine so I dug into the ingredients and discovered that there is a retinol in the formula that was causing the problem This product does work however if you have rosacea I would not recommend using this , This is what youre looking for The bestttttttt glow serum which gives you a healthy looking skin along with that beautiful glow on the face , I received this product free for my honest review I love an affordable serum This serum absorbs well into the skin and doesnt leave that heavy oily feel , This Ultra Glow Serum Glow  Strengthen Vitamin C Serum was easy to rub on my face It was oily and it didnt make my skin feel no wayas in a bad way lol , OMG Ive tried a few vitamin c serums and none of them worked to brighten my skin and this is only 20 and it actually works The hype is real yall Now I cant live without this , Easy to apply and my skin really has a nicer glow after using for a few weeks   I use right after a shower when my skin is warm and moist   I alternate with the nicidimide  Zinc serum , It doesnt do much for my skin but I really love the scent It smells like roses Thus serum is not as heavy as Argan oil so you can top it with another product , It just personally didnt do much for me and left my face slightly sticky , I wanted to love this product but it gave me breakouts in one night I normally never ever get breakouts  , This serum is very watery so it sinks into the skin very well It is easy to add on products concealer foundation SPF without it combating It does help to make my complexion look brighter and healthier A little goes a long way as well , After using this product i am pleasantly surprised This has become a product i will now look for during my product refills I love the formula and the scent and am very happy i was able to try this , I absolutely adore this product  Its super hydrating and helped my dry skin , I received this free from Influenster and I am enjoying the product for the most part over these past few weeks , This product did not work for me The consistency of the formula was nice on the skin but I broke out overnight after using it Not great for sensitive skin or try building up when using vitamin C , The serum is lightweight absorbs quickly and doesnt leave any sticky residue Ive noticed a significant improvement in the overall appearance of my skin since incorporating this product into my routine , After using this product Ive come to the conclusion that this has been breaking me out I do not have sensitive skin but I had a horrible reaction It burned and I had hives here and there Wouldnt recommend this for sensitive skin , I received a sample of those product on exchange for my honest review I wish the sample had more product so I could have gotten a better idea how I enjoyed this serum Im only giving a lower score due to the fact that the serum would come out of the container entirely too fast I spilled a majority of mine because of this It would just shoot out as soon as I took the lid off Other than that I enjoyed how the serum felt on my skin even after hours and the smell of the product was good , I received this product on my Influenster Fresh fall Coop Voxbox for free to test in return for my honest review My first impression of the product was that the sample was a bit small It was also my second time using a serum of any kinds I tend to get dry patches on my face during the fallwinter months and after using the serum for about 2 months I did notice a difference on my skin it looked more hydrated and supple and no dry patches I definitely recommend this serum I did purchase a fullsize bottle with my own money The price is super affordable as well , Beware  this product cause my skin to burn and blister I have used vitamin C in the past with wonderful results so not sure why this caused such a reaction I do not have sensitive skin Very painful teaction , Pretty good I enjoy the price point of this serum , After using this product for a couple of weeks I have seen a difference My skin looks hydrated and brighter It looks like I get enough sleep and drink plenty of water , I have sensitive skin and was super excited to try a new vitamin c product I didnt have any issues with the patch test or use and my skin started to even and brighten with use Got the full size to incorporate into my regular routine , I am a big fan of vitamin C and this formula feels great on my skin I felt that is brightened up my under eyes and helped with skin complexion , I love this product because have vitamin C and E both is so good for the skin and is very hidratante and illuminated I love , Im always a little leery about skin care bc since I crossed into my 40s my skin has become super sensitive This product you get your bang for your buck A must add to your skin care routine , I really love this serum I got it as a xmas gift and it feels so good on my skin It smells like a really healthy citrusy orange juice but in skincare version You get a lot of vitamins in this serum and you can tell a bit in how it smells Its amazing , I have combination skin that has been appearing dull this Winter Since trying a sample of this I noticed my skin has a healthydewy appearance Other products make my skin feel tacky but this product absorbs nicely , I recieved this product thru influencer and I really like it Im considering making it a regular staple in my routine , I hardly leave reviews as Im never satisfied with skincare I dont usually buy products twice but this particular product is well worth it and stands by what it claims I noticed my skin became more brighter clearer and glows , To say this product is amazing is an understatement My skin looks amazing  it is clear glowy and has significantly reduced in redness I use this product twice a day  once in the morning and once at night before bed Highly recommend , Im sorry to say that Im a total snob and never buy storebrand items However I received a sample of this and was surprised by what an excellent vitamin C serum it is It is also surprisingly stable Its not sticky and doesnt cause my makeup to slide either My one hint is to be ready to rub it in as soon as it touches your face because the formula is very runny I actually bought a bottle of this instead of my usual Tatcha It makes my complexion look fantastic , I love this serum It leaves my skin looking so dewy and glowing I put it on every morning before moisturizer and sunscreen Its a great serum to add to your morning routine , Great serum Brings out a natural glow I like using it as my skincare routine or before wearing sunscreen , After using this product for couple of days Ive noticed that my skin looks more dewy and glowy It has helped a lot with my winter skin The product is very under hyped , I tried this out because I got a sample of it It was nice it made my skull feel nice and hydrated overnight I was not obsessed with the smell If I didnt have a solid routine I would consider adding this , I have very dull dry skin and this serum was fantastic I normally use the sand and sky glow serum and this performed on that level imo I also have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily and this serum didnt do that I would use again and would recommend to a friend , I really like this serum it absorbs quickly evens out my skin tone and leaves a delicate glow I will definitely repurchase this , I got this as a free sample and Im glad I did It wasnt horrible but it wasnt great either I dont think its something I would buy for myself but I think of could work on someone elses skin type , I am very happy with the serum No issues using it and have seen a more radiant appearance of my skin since I began using in January 2023 I will be buying this as a gift for someone I know who is into serums and with this price point stocking up for myself as well soon , A great affordable vitamin c Be warned though if you live in a place with mosquitos DO NOT WEAR I did just that and my face was bitten because of the flower frangrance in this serum , I like it Gives somewhat a glow however do not expect it to look like you have highlighter on I used it mainly in the morning on the cheeks and forehead The consistency is water like but it does absorb rather well , I used this for a month but I had to discontinue use of it I was looking to incorporate a Vitamin C serum into my routine and I was excited about how wellreviewed and affordable Sephoras Ultra Glow Serum is Unfortunately my skin started to break out after a few days of use and the breakouts got progressively worse My skin returned to normal after I discontinued use I am sure this product would work well for some but if you have sensitive skin or are acneprone I would definitely think twice about buying it andor patch test before you apply it to your face , Honestly I didnt expect much from this product but its actually pretty amazing for what its worth I totally recommend this product , So Ive been using this product for about 2 months and I love love LOVE It really is a super serum in the fact that it has these great ingredients to help promote clearer healthier skin I use it every morning , I use this product for about a month and have been loving it It makes your skin super soft and glowy After I wash my face I use this product and then apply my make up and it doesnt affect how long my make up last all day definitely would recommend I have combination skin and it doesnt make my skin feel oily , This was recommended to me by my sister and it really helped my face be less dry After using half the bottle my face also felt smoother Its not harsh to the skin or anything And my face is super sensitive and this is very mild , I got a sample of this product using Influenster and I was so excited Its lightweight and its not to heavy when you put it on your skin Its absorbs easily but could be a little bit more hydrating , This product was just okay I didnt see any major skin differences but I loved how it felt on my skin , It was a good product for the price It is currently part of my morning routine , Admittedly I purchased this due to necessity and a gift card This product is readily available color was on target and average for the price point The scent is fair I found the consistency thin in that you have to apply a lot of product to get coverage I would prefer the product to have a thicker consistency I would sooner recommend Mad Hip Vitamin C Serum as it has a  better scent consistency and noticeable difference Overall I would say go for this product in a pinch if instore stock is low on other products , I really loved this product So glad I was able to test it , I really like this serum Its lightweight and doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy Ive been using this consistently in the morning after my toner and feel like it has been improving the texture of my skin I would definitely recommend this , I love this product Its now part of my skin care routine , I have sensitive skin so this just didnt work out for me  It stung my face and it became irritated so i wouldnt recommend this product if youre very sensitive , I got this to use as part of my morning routine and love it It smells lovely and applies really easily too I apply it after cleasing my face and having the face completely dry first and then I use hyaluronic acid afterwards as well My texture and skin has improved greatly since adding it to my routine and I find that theres more of a glow too , I love this stuff Ive bought several bottles already and use it to start my day every day Doesnt make me break out and I believe its truly helped the texture of my skin Plus the price cant be beat , I received this serum to sample from influenster and ended up really enjoying it I like how my skin looks and feels after use and that it doesnt have a heavy scent , i received this item through influenster and i loved it its very thin and it doesnt feel greasy i definitely recommend , Loved using this serum It left my skin moisturized and dewy without looking too oily definitely recommend , I love a good vitamin c serum This product did not disappoint I have dry skin and this left my skin looking youthful and glowy , I have combination skin and this product worked very well for me It left my face looking very radiant and hydrated and not oily looking Great product , I received this product to test in exchange for my honest review I am very picky with serums as they are sometimes thick and oily and I dont like the way that lay on my face This product is very thin so it fit in well with my routine I will definitely be purchasing again , i received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest review im genuinely so happy this was gifted to me i have oily and acne prone skin i was hesitant to use this because i didnt want to aggravate existing acne but i had left over hyperpigmentation from previous acne marks after using this for a month i see an improvement in my dark spots ill definitely continue using this in my routine , Instant results Skin looked more even and brighter Love it , I really like this it smells good it has made my skin really glowy in the last month Ive been using it Also I have acne prone skin and it hasnt aggravated it at all Its a good primer too , Me deja la piel con efecto glass skin super hidratada y con brillo lo eh estado amando hasta ahorita el mejor serum de vitamina C que eh probado , After using an entire 05 oz bottle from a set I loved what this did for my pores  I have some pore damage from a student esthetician who zealously performed extractions which wasnt supposed to be part of the facial  This was the first vitamin C serum I have used or E and it was the first product Ive ever used that helped shrink these pores temporarily  I forgot to use it for a few weeksmonths before finishing the bottle and then wasnt sure if it had that same effect at the very end of the bottle  Im not sure but Im definitely going to try it again  I would like to see this product remove the perfume from the formula as there is no need for a perfume in a serum everything else we use is perfumed so we dont need it in a serum  And to me perfume is not a clean ingredient as it can be contaminated with so many notgoodforyou byproducts  Remove the perfume and this would be spoton , This is my first Vitamin C serum and honestly its so good I was hesitant as fist because its really not expensive and when I first put it on it felt tacky But it really has improved someone fly darker areas , This is the best serum I have used already purchased for 3rd time , Amazing value for the price Really enjoy adding face oil to my every day routine , I really enjoy this serum this was my third time repurchasing  This gives my skin a really nice glow and helps with my discolouration , This product does wonders for my skin It leaves it feeling moisturized and bright I put it on my face after my toner and then top it with my sunscreen , I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review I didnt hate it but I also didnt see any benefits  no glow softness or anything like that However I also appreciate that it didnt irritate my sensitive skin or dry it out Maybe with longerterm use Id get some payoff , I loved this product thanks to it my skin feels very good and looks with a warmer tone I highly recommend it it is a wonderful product , I received a sample size from Influenster Given the amount of vitamin C serums in the market I opted out of this one My first try was very irritating since I have super sensitive skin The only pro for this one is the price I would recommend applying this every 23 days for those with sensitive skin , I received Sephora Ultra Glow Serum Glow  Strengthen Vitamin C Serum free to try for my honest opinion I love that it leaves my skin feeling hydrated without feeling sticky I will continue to use this product , I had high hopes for this product I have normal skin no acne issues or dry skin I used this for 2 weeks consistently before forming my opinion here goes This did nothing No glow softness in fact it dulled my skin  had to put , This is a good affordable alternative to some of the more expensive options that are on the market Good quality and feels nice on the skin , Kept my dry skin hydrated helped me look more awake contains vitamin c  e and castor oil , I really enjoyed this serum I received a sample size from Influenster and used most of the product up and would definitely consider purchasing when I am ready for a new vitamin c serum I cant speak to the effectiveness as I just didnt have the product long enough or enough of the product to see results I did like the lightweight feel of the product and also the fact the product absorbed fairly quickly Some vitamin c serums will break me out but I had no issues with this one Great affordable option especially when Sephora runs 30 off Sephora collection items  , tried to incorporate this product three times into my routine resulting in breakouts each and every time , Amazing serum  It make really glow your skin and make it so so soft , This serum is so awesome It leaves my skin soft and bright Its easy to add to a morning routine as it doesnt take up a lot of time , Love this product I have been using it in addition to a hyaluronic acid serum and really love how my skin feels and looks my skin is glowing I will definitely be buying this again and I very highly suggest that you try this product out If youre looking for a new serum try this Its not as thick as most serums it has a similar consistency of water Makes your face feel soo refreshed , This is my third bottle and I absolutely love it Ive had issues with dull dry skin and acne So Ive always been trying out products that work for my sensitive skin This is a serum that goes on smooth and does not have a sticky residue like most other but c serums on the market Thats why I keep coming back to this smooand does not that , Its a really nice serum makes my skin soft and hydrated which is likely the glow part but I dont notice any real longer lasting effects or that its better than my regular moisturizer for making my skin dewy But the price point is great and its a nice morning facial product , This might be a stress but its a dupe for the glow recipe dewy drops Ive tried both and noticed that the consistency is different for both and with this product you would need a little more than the dewy drops to get the same effect however for the price its pretty good , I received this product free from Influenster In exchange for my honest review I used this while travelling and it brightened my skin without irritating it , I received a sample of this product for free from the Influenster app and here is my more than honest review It is not for oily skin  I didnt feel any changes but more oily skin after using this product , You guys This Sephora Ultra Glow Serum is amazing This serum luminates my natural glow  and has immensely decreased the dull dry feeling on my face especially on days I decide to go all natural The scent is very clean and expresses gentle earthy  notes This serum feels as light as air and is very moisturizing  You can feel the moisture and hydration instantly being replenished in my skinWhat I love most about this Serum is that its Clean at Sephora Approved since 97 of its ingredients come from natural  origins The Clean at Sephora Approved is a Clean  Planet Positive program that includes clean ingredients climate commitment sustainable sourcing responsible packaging and environmental givingI lovvve this Sephora Ultra Glow Serum Definitely my new GoTo Thank you Sephora and Influenster for this complimentary product , Love this product Definitely brightened the spots I wanted Will be purchasing again  Highly recommended , Great little vitamin C serum Moisturizes well and absorbs well Doesnt feel too thick and leaves skin supple and glowing , This has helped the darker spots on my skin and it makes seem more radiant and it totally works better than any other product on the market thats at a similar price point , I recieved this from Influenster but all opinions are my own I freaking love this I was a little worried it would be too dewy for me but its just perfection , This was a good serum for traveling when I didnt want to risk my luxury vitamin C products Im thankful to Influencer for providing a free sample to test and review and after enjoying the product this would be a good option for someone just getting into skincare It was fragrance free and gentle on my skin Lightweight so ideal for all skin types  even oily Because I was only provided a sample I cannot comment on longterm effects however buyers beware of vitamin C serums sold in clear glass containers as light affects the efficacy and shelf life of vit c , I honestly really wasnt impressed by this product I didnt feel like it hydrated my face I actually feel like it left my face a little dry I personally wouldnt purchase this item , I tried this product and I thought it was good It seemed light and thin I dont like thicker greasier products Glad I was able to try this product , Ive been using this for a little while and I think its one product that takes awhile to see a decent change I have a few spots that i wish would even out more but over all this was a good product  I will finish it all before deciding if I want to repurchase , A bit thin for a vitamin c Didnt like this as much as other vitamin c serums Ive used But its nice if youre just getting into serums , I got this to try it out and if Im being honest I dont think it does anything but it does feel nice going on the skin It has a very nice consistency , It feels nice on the skin but its a little too watery for me Its hydrating boy its not like changing , I received this product as a free sample I have sensitive skin and it just did not suit my skin well Im sure it would be great for someone who doesnt have skin issues , So far so good I am prone to scarring and hyperpigmentation I feel like my scars are slowly getting better The best part is I didnt break out with this product so thats a win for me , I received this to try and WOW  I Wasnt expecting much but wow  This was great my skin feels and looks so refreshed and dewy  I would definitely recommend this product , It looks nice on the skin but to be honest Im not sure if I see any real changes Ill continue to use my sample size though I received this in exchange for my honest review , Feels great Not noticing any change yet but really like how it feels on my skin , Great product I dont know if its the holy grail but its so soft and does feel luxurious , I really enjoyed this product It brightened up my face from what I saw  its not sticky at the end like a lot of serums I have tried Definitely buying again , I really like this serum It really brightened my skin and gave it a nice glow  I have sensitive skin and if didnt bother it at all I also have dry skin and didnt cause any issues there either It was easily applied and went on smooth , Loved how this made my skin feel I really enjoyed the citrusy burst i received this product for free through influenster but all opinions are my own , I received only a sample size product so I feel like to really have an opinion on the long term effects I would have to use for more time Overall it didnt give me any reactions and seems ok I have dry sensitive acne prone skin , This product did not work for my skin in particular I did not notice a difference with it I do have combination skin so this may have been one reason as to why , This serum just simply does not for me I noticed no brightening effects which i would typically expect from  a vitamin c product even after multiple uses The scent of the product also leaves something to be desired and did not leave me wanting to apple it desiredlefleft definitely This serum just simply does not for me I noticed no brightening effects which i would typically expect from a vitamin c product even after multiple uses The scent of the product also leaves something to be desired and although not bad persay it definitely did not make me want to apply it The texture is more watery that gel so be aware of that But all in all it just didnt do enough for me to continue using it in my routine , I loved this I need the full size version now Feels great on the skin and gave me a great glow Didnt break me out or cause any irritation , I really enjoyed using this product  It has a very light but pleasant scent Its very liquidy but absorbs so nicely and leaves my skin feeling recharged  Its definitely a great addition to any skincare routine , I received a free trial size of this product from Influenster I wish There was more to see the long term effects but so far I like it Its very light and absorbs easily My face feels moisturized I would definitely purchase this I have very dry spots in the winter and it worked well , I revived a trial size product so its almost hard to tell how well it worked But product wise this one was very thin At first it was hard to get used to applying because of that but after time I started to like it It felt like it seeped into my pores well and has a pleasant scent Ingredientswise it doesnt seem like there is a lot of vitamin C in it Im pretty neutral on this product , this is the only vitamin c serum that hasnt made me break out it has a nice consistency does not pill and absorbs into the skin really nicely , Save your money and try medical grade Not sure this is worth it , I have tried many high end vitamin c sedums and I can definitely vouch for this being so competitive I love using it and has been really doing a wonderful job on my skin , Tried this product for a week and i can already see changes in my skin , This was an ok product It gave a lil extra hydration to my skin but wasnt anything wow amazing It didnt irritate my skin which is why Im giving it 4 stars bc thats huge plus for me I would give it another try find a better moisturizer to use with it to see more of a glow bc I didnt notice that , It was nice to try a Sephora skincare product  I have dry skin and this serum did not irritate my skin  My skin feels hydrated and mixes well with my other skincare products , My skin feels pretty quenched These winter months do a real number on my skin this was a non greasy solution , I received this complimentary sample from Influenster in exchange of my honest opinionI have been using this serum for a week and I have really seen changes in my skin I have oily skin and I did not have any negative effects when using it it has a light fragrance and a watery consistency I really loved it it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated , I used this on myself and on my clients and this was honestly very hydrating and left a really nice glow It sinks into the skin and doesnt make anything look overly shiny Love it , Not really sure if it works or not Didnt do much Should try it for longer receivedfreeforreviewing complimentary voxbox , I was actually really surprised with this product The sample is a good amount and tried it for at least two weeks everyday It is a watery consistency I would drip it onto my skin directly and spread it evenly with my fingers in the morning I would consider buying this product after using this sample I got from influenster 4 stars is a great rating for me since Im picky and think that most products are the same It takes a lot for me to give 5 stars for anything , I really enjoy this serum It is hydrating without being sticky and Ive noticed my skin is a bit brighter after using this for several weeks The serum smells great too My only complaint is the packaging because it is so small it gets easily lost , So Ive been trying this out compared to the OH serum I usually use This is a great alternative for price b"
Ultra Glow Toner with Vitamins C + E,"It takes off any extra makeup you have and its really dewy and I love it , I love this toner in the morning Really does give a nice glow and doesnt leave a noticeable feeling on my skin , ive had this product for a little over a month  now and I had the sample size a little goes a long way its light weight has a nice shine to it in the end and my skin responded very well after applying it  I have dry skin and in midst winter and so it brightens face up before I even apply my serums and moisturizers Its lovely and great price , Overly drying and overly exfoliating for my sensitive combooily skin It took about a month to rehab my skin after this It didnt do anything for my dark spots or brightening needs It was just way too irritating for no good reason , I really wanted to like this product as I really love the cleanser but this toner broke me out in little bumps Almost hive like after several uses Hopefully it work out for someone else but it did not work for my sensitive skin , I love the way it works I use it every morning before my skin care and every night after I take a bath it definitely helps take all the leftover makeup and the skin looks amazing , I am 27 and have had problem skin since age 13  unrelenting acne that worsens with hormonal changes dry oily you name it I am always on the verge of starting Accutane because no product has really helped BUT after a week of using this toner I have genuinely noticed that it has even my skin toned and reduced breakouts Ive left like all of maybe 3 reviews on Sephora in my life and this product definitely deserves one I love how my skin looks soft smooth and even Im genuinely impressed and surprised with how well it works , I was hesitant to try this product as I dont tend to switch my skin care routine up but this toner is amazing Right away my skin was shinier and smoother I will continue to use this twice daily and Im so excited to see the results in a month , This has been the only product I have ever used on my face I can tell actually did something I use this twice daily and my skin looks so much better in a short time Definitely buying again , This product has been an excellent one to try and something I will repurchase Leaves my skin glowing and refreshed and helps my other products sink into my skin Of course toners arent necessary to a skin care routine Id say give this a try if youre in the market for a toner , Ive been using this for a few weeks and love the results It pairs well with the vitamin C  E serum and you do glow , This is a very nice toner more so considering the modest price It does not dry my mature skin and Ive received compliments about my complexion since Ive been using this , Love this product My skin is very dry so using it before applying make up keeps it hydrated , Loving this glow toner I have sensitive skin and my skin loves this And at that price point you cant go wrong , Im really loving this product so far it seems like its helping my skin I just wish I would see more results such as my skin tone especially my face Sunspots and uneven discolored spots would help start evening out by now But Ill keep using it morning and night and then I will update my review when I finish the bottle , Theeeeee BEST toner out there I love how natural this is and how It makes me glow even more with my other products , did nothing for my skin and the glow was barely there , A nice gentle toner Id recommend letting it dry thoroughly as it leaves a bit of a sticky film Almost dont need a moisturizer with this one , Not sure about the brightening effect but is a decent toner for the price , Made all products pill after using this toner Everything else was the same the only thing I changed was this toner As soon as I stopped using it it was all better Was hoping to like this productbut didnt work out , Absolutely love this product It reduced my redness almost immediately and gave a nice plump A good alternative to the glow recipe toner , This toner just does not work with my skincare routine Every product I applied after this toner started to pill up and just flake off of my skin Ive tried using less and Ive tried waiting 5 mins before applying serum moisturizer and spf but it still happens When I apply the same products without this toner everything goes on normally so I know the toner is the problem Ill be returning this for something else , I was excited to try this product because I have been a big fan of the Ren Glow Tonic in the past and figured this was a good dupe I also like that this is a clean beautyvegan brand  It is hard to see results quickly with this type of product though I didnt really notice a difference in my skin if anything I actually broke out t didnt work super well for my skin unfortunately , Always a fan of Sephoras product especially when it comes to their clean line Didnt irritate my skin and it didnt strip my skin of its moisture either Theres a slight tackiness to it but it didnt really bother me , Love this product it had my skin looking the BEST EVER Will be so excited to repurchase and I did not expect this outcome from this product INNN

the best It was thicker stickier than my favorite toner and it anything it made my breakout worse even on tretinoin It didnt keep my skin smooth the way the Deep Sweep toner does I used this in combination with some other Sephora brand skincare I received and was very underwhelmed , toners and essences are my favorite step when it comes to my skincare routine this toner has a very liquid consistency i usually use my hands to pat it in it leaves my skin nice and plumped and hydrated but it does leave a slight tackiness i havent seen the glow effects yet but so far not bad for the price

light feel and is quite watery with no smell or its very unnoticeable I would recommend it for dry skin but rather for normal and I would only use it during spring or summer since its not heavy enough

Vegan Makeup Remover and Cleansing Brush,"Great part of my skin care routine  Loving using with my cleansing  Easy to clean brush after use , My skin is very complicated annoying Generally its  rude and disrespectful towards me and my makeup goals haha This is a great cleaning brush but its not strong enough for my personal preference , Lovely really helps clear out pores I am not usually one to buy this sort of thing but I really liked this brush Its soft and doesnt irritate my skin at all , Eh its okay Its great to have in your cabinet for when you travel but in my opinion its nothing special Its pretty small which makes it nice for around your nose but thats about it , Its good Not sure if its the shape of my nose or the shape of the brush or possibly both in combination but all this does it get product into my nostrils whenever I use it near my nose Id rather stick to those teardrop shaped silicone pads This does leave my skin feeling very clean though when I do use it , I love this brush soooo much Had to buy 3 more for my nieces , I needed a brush for my skin care routine its a pretty good brush but I will say I have to scrub kinda hard to feel the middle of the brush , after using is for a while it immediately turned yellow i couldnt continue using it i dont recommend it at all , I really didnt like the combo of silicone  bristles on this brush It doesnt distribute my cleansing foam any better than using my own fingers The silicone in the middle feels uncomfortable on the face and doesnt do anything for me Turns out I am not even using it I would have liked this better if it was just a soft normal brush to make a foam with my cleanser and spread it over my face , I started using this lil brush after I broke out really bad from wearing the masks I used it with my regular cleanser but that lil brush really gets all the dirt and dead skin off and is very gentle on the skin A must have , I was hesitant at first to get it because I thought the bristles were stiff like the Clarisonic brushes I WAS WRONG The bristles on this item are soft and flexible It allows me to clean hard to reach places like the sides of nose near my eyeskeep eyes shut when doing this I am reordering another one , This brush is a combo of super soft bristles on the outside and silicone like nubby bristles in the center  I bought the brush to use with my daily facial cleansing routine and as for circulation stimulation and gentle exfoliation  Its perfect for both  I pair it with a weekly cleaning of the brush with a makeup brush cleaning treatment to keep it fresh and let it dry in between uses , Ill preface by saying I only use this brush to cleanse my face after Ive already removed makeup I doublecleanse and I dont use this brush to remove makeup specifically as a first step Ive been using this brush for a while now and I can say that I like it pretty well The brush head is small but its nice for scrubbing all the more smaller areas of the face that might be harder to get to with a large brush The handle is nice and grippy so when I use it in the shower its unlikely to slip out of my hand while using It has a very simple aesthetic but is still pleasing to look at I will say that I dont really care for the silicone bristles bunched up in the middle of the brush head They are recessed too far back compared to the softer fiber bristles so I dont really ever feel like theyre scrubbing my face as much It is also harder to rinse out product from the middle of the brush since those bristles are so tightly bunched together I would love to see a different version of this brush without silicone bristles or at the very least incorporating them into the design in a different wayMy biggest gripe by far though is the lack of a stand to set this brush on I get that the exclusion of a stand or some way to hang up the brush probably cuts the cost but I would have gladly paid a couple extra bucks for some way to store the brush when not in use The solution I resorted to is to hang the brush by the brush had on my small shower caddy on some hooks that might normally be used for a razor handle or something similar Its a decent fix but I often accidentally knock the brush off while reaching for my other products and its a little annoying to deal withOverall I believe this is a really nice skincare tool that is a good compromise if you dont want to spend that much money However I think it could be a lot better with a few design improvements Its still a pretty good bang for your buck , Its cute and soft Gets light makeup off well For some reason I thought it would be bigger but the size of the brush itseld is good enough , I purchased this brush because I wanted a better clean on my skin and I absolutely love it The fine bristles insures that I dont waste any product and I can use a smaller amountno more wasteful uses of expensive facial washes ladies and gents Its a great little addition to your skin care routine and its travel friendly I ended buying two because I use it everyday I wish the brush could have been made just a little bit bigger but still a great buy , Gets the job done but very simple Great for people new to Skincare , The cleansing brush is so soft and removes product from your face very well Use in circular motions for the best results , What can I sayI just bought this today and came home after a full day of shopping and used it right away and I instantly fell in love this cleansing brush it is so soft and very light weight It made my skin super soft Wish I had bought more to give as gifts Highly recommend , Hi I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador I wasnt sure if this would be too harsh for my sensitive skinIt is not thankfully The bristles feel soft and I can use it like a Litmus test when the foundation has washed off It rinses clear within seconds without staining the bristles This will help me complete the 1st part of the double cleanse easier and faster , This tool has been a great addition to my routine I dont use it daily but when I wear a full face of makeup its nice to use  I purchased one myself to keep in my shower thats how much I loved it I use a face oil to remove any makeup and then I apply my cleanser to the brush and gently in circular motion I cleanse my face It doesnt irritate my skin but I have very dry patches around my chinmouth area and this hasnt cause any irritation Highly recommend and its a great price point as well , this product could potentially be good forsomeone with a little less sensitive skin but for me is was just really abrasive and it left my face red , Super soft I love how its not bulky and I can just take with me when I travel if need be  I love how its not so rough on the face or neck when cleansing my face , Super soft bristles that seem gentle enough to exfoliate without damaging the skin barrier I tend to not use physical tools like this in my skincare routine but it definitely feels like it could be safe to use when needed especially if used to remove a lot of make up  If youre someone who likes using tools like this I would recommend you try this out , Love this product Super gentle  it leaves my skin baby smooth every time Its easy to clean with soap  water This is my favorite skincare tool right now , Im used to using micellar water to

contours I tried that and it feels rough on the eye lids since the area is delicate so wont be able to remove eye makeup with this I like this cleansing brush more for washing off face masks because masks are typically thicker in consistency so you can get a nice little massaging action going I wouldnt consider this a musthave but its a nice budget friendly alternative to some of the electronic

effective I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review , Ohhh feels like butter on my skin Never used a brush cleanser before and my life has changed a little Feels soft but also clearing , Really good to clean of"
Vitamin C Skincare Set,"I am excited about his experience I will try it and give you a view  The size of the packages is very small , Love the serum and the mask Its feels amazing on skin and its super hydrating It is not sticky and love the smell of the serum I will repurchase this , Been using this kit for 3 days and i loved itMy skin is mora healthier glowy and hydrated Super cheap basic routine that you must try , I confessI obsessed with the Sephora skincare line Its affordable AND it works , I already use the glow serum everyday but the mask and toner make great for travel toiletries , Had me glowing like a full moon on a cloudless night I absolutely love it , All the 5 stars are for the serum I saw a huge difference in my overall complexion after a week of usage I used twice a day initially and then brought it down to once a day now I use the targeted pore serum in the evenings I like to use a roller for application and top it with almond oil My skin is generally clear but had some blemishes and uneven tone I normally do not use make up The serum helped to even out those patches and brightened up my dull face well I used the toner only once and didnt like it as I found it drying I am going to try it after a couple of months , Great kit I enjoyed the items only thing is the mask was a tad heavy on my faceOverall great size and a little goes a long way , I love this line it is affordable and it makes my skin glow , These sets are great if you are not sure and want to try before committing to full sizes  The price is easy on the wallet too  The serum is a bit sticky at first so let it dry before applying moisturizer  And the toner  Wow a new fav for sure  Great for sensitive dry skin , May not be the absolute best quality out there but I feel like this set is good for the price , Le srum laisse un fini collant cest dsagrable"
Vitamin Eye Masks,"Really helped my puffy under eyes This product has a great price point for its benefits Will be re purchasing , I feel like everyone buys a couple of these and determines they work ok or dont work at all When if you read the description you actually need to use these for 28 days consistently to see some of the results Well ladies and gentleman I bought 30 of these 10 x 3 orders This is day 20 and I have to sayTHESE WORK My under eye circles are better not completely gone Not looking for miracles though the concealer I do use is about half as much as I used to and it goes on easier I use these as part of my night time routine to me its a great deal and a must have in your routine , So I have used the Vitamin C eye mask about 10 days ago I applied the patches as indicated and left them on for about 5 minutes My under eyes started to be extremely dry red and itchy two days after use See picture as reference Its getting a little worse everyday I havent changed anything to my under eye routine so I doubt an order lotion is to blame here Kind of annoying Would not recommend , these left me with dry patches around my eyes not sure what ingredient caused this but not gonna buy these again , Love they depuff and brighten I have really dark circles and bags and I been using for about two weeks twice a week and I really see a dramatic difference overall , It has worked so well Great for undereye bags I LOVE THESE SO MUCH Im about to go get more AHHH , I bought a couple of these to give guests when they stay over as a nice addition to the morning While they feel fantastic on your face I dont know that they make a huge difference on puffiness and under eye hydrating more than the standard skincare routine I recommend keeping a set of these in the fridge and applying them cold to the area to help reduce puffiness if that is what you are after for the purpose , Im pretty much obsessed with these little gems I love them and cannot believe how moisturizing they are and I so add them to my cart every time I place a new Sephora order Highly recommend 1010 , it smells amazing to be honest i dont really think it did a difference it doesnt irritate the eyes its very gentle and smooth definitely recommend it for dry skin , This product is inexpensive but does nothing so wont be ordering again , All the Sephora eye masks are the same and not great I will usually add something cheap to my basket if I am trying to reach a certain threshold and this was new They feel fine but dont do anything at all I dont recommend , Feel so relaxed I will highly recommend it Want to buy again , I liked it it was refreshing Convenient and easy to apply , Nice and refreshing They work great Helps with puffiness , Absolutely fantastic worked like a charm to clear up puffiness and make the eye bags disappear , It was nice and smooth on my skin But I really wasnt a a big fan of how it smelled , Love this patches they work and they feel very cool on the skin , Only came with one pad not one pair literally just one pad for one eye It didnt feel like it was hydrating my skin but instead drying it out On top of that after the five minutes were up there was no difference , I love these I have super sensitive skin and these dont irritate or burn very hydrating and gives you a glowy boost And I love that theyre clean I prefer the Sephora brand eye masks to a lot of the pricey brand name ones , This gave my under eye a decent amount of moisture  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is how its packaged  There are 2 overlays on each pad so be sure to read the directions  I didnt at first , Dcevant  jai reu 1 masque et demiUn tait normal pais et solide et lautre tait une moiti fragile et tellement mince Inutile , The Vitamin C Eye mask that i purchased only had one eye mask inside so bummed out , Feels nice on my skin cleared the puffiness and some of the shadows under my eyes , I have had some dryness under my eyes and this really help hydrate it and help it become smoother , Brightens and moisturizes under eyes so quickly Perfect to use before applying makeup Makes applying concealer seamless and doesnt cake , Fun little eye masks Smell nice Feel good on your face I put mine in the fridge for a cooling effect Only complaint was the packaging of them One eye mask was significantly thicker than the other and one was paper thin , These eye gels are amazing My under eye is more hydrating and not as saggy These eye gels are easy to put in the fridge and wear cold Not greasy or heavy to wear , Nice to use for relaxing and pampering yourself Not sure for the long term results but I sure do like the refreshing and light fragrance and put excess liquid around the remaining parts of my eyes , I dont use eye patches very often but I picked up two of these to try out for fun I love them They stay in place on the face and smell very nice , These eye masks are amazing Underneath my eyes are left feeling fresh and dewy after using them , Theyre okay but nothing special The eye cream I use does a better job But these smell nice , I found these eye patches difficult to use as the packaging was soaked with a gel like substance although it was not irritating it made it slippery and difficult for me to separate the patches from the protective barrier , Obsessed with this eye mask Seriously its great It has decreased the lines around my eyes I get creases under my eyes from sleeping on the side of my face I love the smell and easy application I hope Sephora makes this a staple Please keep it in the Sephora collection , Hesitant to tell people about these because theyre just that good Im a skincare snob and have used everything under the sun including Peter Thomas Roth cult favorite eye patches and these take the cake Hydrating stay in place and super cheap Please never stop selling these Win win win , Love Sephora eye masks theres so much product that you can reuse these a few times I put mine in my fridge and they feel amazing and you  definitely see an improvement after the first use I highly  recommend this product its great quality at a great price"
Vitamin Face Masks,"The smell is divine While the results arent that striking I certainly felt refreshed and my skin had more of a glow to it , I used this only one time since Ive been pregnant  about a month ago and TBH I love this mask This illuminated my skin I seen a brighter difference and I loved how it felt on my skin I do wish it was more in the pact at least two but I am satisfied with the product , Bought this because I like the feel of sheet mask but I wasnt expecting it to have a lasting impact on my skin I used this a few days ago and my face is still brighter after repeated washing and makeup wear , After using this product my skin feels so hydrated with a beautiful glow 1010 , Nice little treat Bought for my niece and she likes them she does sheet masks often and these are her favorite , Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts My niece seems to like them and she feels bougie shes happy Im happy  , This mask was really nice Left skin feeling smooth and with a bit of a glow I cant say if it really did anything for my skin longterm and its a bit pricey for just one mask but it smells nice and was comfortable to wear , These masks dot have very much effect on my face I like them because it just feels nice but if your only using it to get the benefit listed on the package I would hold off on this purchase , used this to relax after a long day very cooling and refreshing I did keep it on for longer than it was recommended but there were no negative side effects I woke up the next morning with very plump hydrated skin  , il donne un rendu magnifique et la peau brille et est vraiment hydrate Ma peau est beaucoup plus ferme , Best and favorite mask from Sephora Keeps me skin smelling great and beautiful , Made my skin so soft and refreshed after using it  , I had this sitting in my bathroom for a bit and decided to use it today There was an instant difference after removing the mask The product absorbed very well into my skin There was an instant glow hydration and suppleness There was an excess that I slathered on my neck and chest Ill definitely be purchasing more , JadoreReferme les pores et une peau plus clatante , It is not as nice as the old aloe mask And why does it list as Vitamin B when the package says Vitamin E Did not feel very quenching at all , This made my skin so soft and smooth This is now my goto face mask , Full of fragrance I thought it wouldnt be too bad but yes its pretty bad I took it off my face right away And just smeared the stuff on my arms"
Vitamin Mask,"I got the vitamin E hydrating mask its super softening and nice for a couple hours but my skin starts to flake later on in the day from the cold months So not overly hydrating , This product is great for hydrating the skin and a nice self care treat Ive used it on my face so far and by the time I washed it off everything felt so soft including lips Hoping to try the matcha  vitamin H when its back in stock , Skin feels so nice and soft after using My boyfriend didnt know I used it but even he said I looked like I was glowing , I did not like this mask It just sorts in your face wet and did nothing for my skin Will not but again , leaves my skin feeling so amazing and smells good , The vitamin c mask definitely brightens skin and leaves it glowing , Made my skin feel great I left it on double the time the second time I used it as I have really dry skin , This mask did nothing for my skin didnt even leaved my skin feeling soft or clean , For several years since knee surgery Ive had dry and chapped skin on my knees along the scars and also very dry and chalky shins  Ive used difference moisturizers with no noticeable results  With one treatment of this mask the dryness is completely gone  No more itchy chalky skin  I was shocked  I have sensitive skin and I didnt wash the mask off until my shower  I love this product and highly recommend it  The coconut smell is divine , I use this cream every time I dermaplane my face It works perfectly I now have a smooth face with minimal blemishes and dark spots Do wash this off somewhat quickly though especially if you have sensitive skin The first few times that I used this I didnt wash it off fast enough and ended up breaking out Otherwise wonderful though , I use this as an overnight hand mask and absolutely love it Hands have never been softer , I love a face mask but this one didnt really do it for me unfortunately , I love this have starting using it every morning as part of my daily routine its that lovely So hydrating pleasant scent feels extremely luxurious , Its a little thick like frosting Not bad just not my kind of texture Hard to wash off but very hydrating I recommend putting it in the fridge the cooling sensation is very nice and improved my experiences with this mask , Very impressed by the results with this mask very calming to the skin and moisturizing as well Perfect for your skin when it needs a more gentle approach , Great mask  Its whipped  creamy  goes on smooth and leaves skin feeling moisturized and hydrated  Thankyou Sephora for making a clean product free of harmful chemicals  affordable , im a sucker for anything matcharelated so i already knew id love this  been looking for a cream mask for those nights where you need a little extra selfcare and this one works perfect not a lifechanging formula by any means but it brightened up my skin and made my selfcare night even better highly recommend for those with normal skin who dont have many issues but want to brighten up their complexion and alleviate redness without breaking the bank another great sephora collection item , Ive tried the watermelon Vitamin E mask in both the warmer and cooler months and feel like its alright It doesnt irritate my skin but I wouldnt say it standouts amongst other masks with similar claims I should preface that opinion which is my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Member as an opinion of someone who has gone through a ton of masks with similar claims and as such may have be really picky about my hydrating masksThis is on the richer thicker side as far as hydrating masks go Even so it spreads smoothly and easily The scent is subtle I can pick up some watermelon in the scent but it is very faint what I pick up more prominently smells of a fruityfloral blend Its pleasant though slightly synthetic My skin feels lightly hydrated after washing off the mask with lukewarm water and a wash cloth but not more so than most hydrating masks Ive also used this on my hands legs and feet but not as a mask more as a lotion  cream and it does a nice job in the warmer months when I need something hydrating and moisturizing but not heavy or greasy This feels light on the skin and does not leave behind a residue or film , Theres no watermelon scent which I enjoy but this feels like plastic on your face   I did not enjoy that feeling I might use this as a hand or foot mask instead since I dont return products , This mask makes me skin feel so soft and bouncy It evens my skintone and makes it very radiant Definitely recommend it , Not good not bad This seems like something you just use for fun instead of results It didnt break me out and it makes your skin a little softer but I wouldnt repurchase , I have drycombo skin  Purchased this on a whim and plan to always have this on hand My skin is glowing for at least three days after i use this Obsessed The scent is not too overwhelming but is a bit fake The texture is definitely like conditioner which is weird But Ive stopped using my daily vitamin c serum because using this 12 times a week before bed does the job for me now , it was ok made my skin feel really oily wouldnt purchase again , B3 mask is amazing Made my skin soft as a babies bottom after first use I seen a huge difference in the texture of my skin , Its seriously so hydrating As soon as you put it on it just melts into your skin Not traditionally like the masks that harden onto your face The texture is that of a thicker creamy lotion or body butter You can double it as lip sleeping mask It just melts into your lips , This mask is so underrated it makes my skin so plump and healthy Its very soothing and my skin has never been better I would recommend this for any skin type especially if you need that hydration and if your skin gets red a lot  , This mask Vitamin C did good for me It not only made my face brighter and more pure looking than it usually doesI break out easy and have many skin issues it also hydrated my skin well enough that I personally didnt need a moisturizer after Two pictures taken in different light I am one satisfied customer , Jai vue une grande diffrence depuis que je lutilise Ma peau est beaucoup moi sche et je sens que ma peau est plus frache , I love this mask for my dry and sensitive skin I was it off after 10 minutes but it still makes my skin feel nourished Great value too , I really love this mask I tried it because of the price point but I like it better than the sand  sky emu apple bounce mask definitely worth it gives a great glow  bounce , This was a lovely mask its a like a concentrated face lotion goes in sheer white rub it in let it sit for 10 minutes and then rinse it off it does not leave an oily film at all Your face feels moisturized and clean after you rinse it off , I use this mask around 2 times a week It leaves my skin feeling soft and glowing , The texture of this mask is almost whipped its very different Im not sure I like it  I have used it a couple times and the main thing Im disappointed about is the smell There is NO TRACE of grapefruit It smells kind of like Christmas to me if that makes any sense I was looking forward to a bright nice grapefruit smell when using this so that was a bummer But its a big size for the price , Love this mask The texture is amazing it hydrates skin just as promised Not a fan of products with fragrance  but this mask smells amazing and its not pungent at all , Every self care Sunday I use this facial mask for relaxing and relaxation and meditation After I rinse my face feels clean and beautiful afterwards , This mask makes my skin super soft and hydrated Results last until the next day Its quite creamy as opposed to a mask texture but it works , If you need an instant glow on ur face than thats the best mask for you I am truly impressed with the pricequality and quantity , I usually put on this mask before I apply my make up to give myself nice and glowing skin However when I do it does leave my skin a little tingly but it does go away Ill still continue to use it as it doesnt give me any other reaction , If youre looking for good value in a moisturizing mask this is worth a try Its thick creamy and soothing The grapefruit scent is light and doesnt smell super artificial It noticeably moisturizes but I havent seen any other effects I have oily acne prone skin and it doesnt break me out even if I leave some of the extra product on my skin which is a win I find myself reaching for it when my skin is feeling dry even with a drawer full of other options , I am 60 years old and have very dry skin I tryed Watermelon  Vitamin E mask and this is amazing for dry skin My skin is like a baby skin pinkish and glowing I recomend it for all women with dry skin Just try it , Honestly I really like this vitamin mask Ill definitely buy it again Its very hydrating and my skin feels very smooth after Its worth it , Purchase both the matcha and grapefruit masks As someone very sensitive to scent both were light and didnt linger on the skin after Thats about where the positives end The Matcha maskmeant to help purify skin and poresleft my skin feeling like there was a heavy wax on it after washing off An hour later it hadnt settled into my skin and I had to wash my face again from scratch to get it to somewhat come off Maybe thats what you want to happen with a moisturizing mask but not one meant to clean excess junk out of your skin Didnt want to try the grapefruit after that experience and took them back to Sephora , These are also a body mask meaning that its VERY heavy and not completely targeted for facial skin This isnt advertised on the picturedescription so thought Id sharePretty average mask I bought all of them and didnt see a difference between them The fact it doubles as a body mask bothers me bc my skin ALWAYS breaks out with dual purpose products , I have good skin normally when I stick to a routine However like every young girl I have breakouts that completely take over my face sometimes I bought the Grapefruit Vitamin C mask of this brand the red tub and I LOVE it Like LOVE Its amazing Makes my skin feel amazing and really helps with breakouts , Doesnt smell like matcha Smells like a weird chemically green apple HOWEVER it really brightens my skin and softens it also a lot comes for the price , I was looking for a good soothing moisturizing mask and came across this one I got the coconut and vitamin b3 one Ive tried A LOT of masks I really enjoy skincare and masking My favorite are Fresh and Tatcha masks but at 10 I figured this was at least worth trying Its not good though Its frustrating when most of the 5 star ratings on products are incentivized it feels like a less honest review Basically this did nothing for my skin after I washed it off It felt no different or maybe even a little worse Definitely not soothing or moisturizing I think this is the kind of mask maybe a teenager might buy for a sleepover Like to put on for fun not for benefits Im 29 and this just didnt do it for me Another thing was the smell I didnt take off any stars for it because I try to focus on the effectiveness of a product unless the smell is so unbearable I have to remove it But Ill warn you it smells and kinda feels like youre putting thick sunscreen on your face Ill probably be returning it or just throwing it away , Really thick I did not feel or notice a difference in my face feel like I couldve got this anywhere and it did nothing It did smell nice though , Its amazing I loved this face packI bought it for my dull skin and I found it too good , This stuff is absolutely the best Most masks burn my skin This is amazing I love how it makes my skin feel , This mask surprised me I have redness on my cheeks from previous bad sun damage and the vitamin E combined with the watermelon hydrates my skin and once rinsed off and used 2 times a week or when I need hydration this really does the trick and I notice my skin looking less red  Ive tried other products like origins drink up and origins hemp masks and I have to say this is WAY better and less expensive and has more product Please never discontinue , Not for me  caused me to break out  I didnt mind the texture its like putting a deep conditioner on your face or the smell  And my skin felt GREAT afterward  However my skin broke out less than 24 hours later  My skin isnt sensitive and does well with most products  be careful , Feels great Havent seen a massive difference in my skin after 2 weeks but not a bad product , I LOVE this mask It makes my skin glow once I rinse it off you see noticeable difference immediately , this mask is awesome Never had a soft smooth and shiny skin before I luv this , GURRRLLLSSS AND GUYSSSSS I had the most stressful last five days and Im talking on the verge of a breakdown everyday type of stresss okay My eyes had the darkest circles they HURT from staring at the computer my skin was dry and my face felt so strained from stresss WHEN I PUT ON THIS MASK OH MY GODDD MY face felt like it was in paradise It felt like I was a whole new person And even better I woke up to the softest skin ever and a subtle glow I RECOMMEND 1000 , I was gifted this product in exchange for my honest opinion However I love this product I use it all over my body while showering and then rinse Leaves my body sooo smooth Love it , Probably the yummiest  softest mask Ive used yet My skin was nourished immediately Would very much use again Its also nice  slippy so be careful making a mess when applying A great value too , I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review I have the Vitamin B3 mask It has a

milk vitamin mask from Sephora and let me tell you its a life changer Both my fianc and I suffer from dry skin all yeararound since we live in Texas and the dessert weather combined with winter just doesnt do it for us Since we started using this product about a biweekly basis in the last month we started to see some instant results to our dry skin problemsTo give you an idea my fianc has more of an oily skin while my skin tends to be more on the dryer side When applying we both felt an immediate soothingcooling sensation and as we got closer to that 10 minute mark we started to feel a bit of a tingly sensation which is pretty common with face mask However no burning or tightness occurred when using this mask In addition my fianc has a beardmustache and he says it has help him keep that area of his face extra moisturized and with no dry flakes The consistency of the product is a bit watery so a little goes a long way The best way to apply this product if with your fingers tips we noticed that when we applied it with a brush more of the product got stuck on the brush than the skin so would recommend to just apply it as you apply your daily moisturizer Overall I give this product a 55 and would recommend , It is so refreshing to know that Ive finally found my new favorite vitamin mask My skin has really been suffering this winter so much dry skin After a few uses of this Vitamin Mask Im already seeing and feeling a difference My cheeks feel so smooth and the dry skin redness is already clearing up Highly recommend , I have combination skin and usually dont have

Vitamin Tonic,"This little small bottle of tonic is fabulous It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated I actually use this after a toner This tonic is one of the best products Sephora has that is so simple and unassuming I have this and every set they have available , Love this toner I wish it came in a bigger bottle It is perfect for traveling though , Its very refreshing and hydrates my skin well the bottle is just too small if your using it twice a day its not going to last , It hydrates my skin well It takes a while for my skin to absorb I use this every morning , Love love love this Great for hydration and also if your skin is burning it helps relieve the itchiness and burn , so refreshing try putting it in a skincare fridge , Works great but the bottle is so small I went through it very quickly but I did use it every day morning and night its a great product I just wish it wasnt so tiny , Great prodcut Great value I see a visible difference in the skin when I use this Clarifies and softens skin instantly , Absolutely excellent for pores I saw results fast , smells good and makes my face feel soft but havent noticed any changes , Amazing  So soothing Has a refreshing tingle Would definitely recommend for a gentle cleaner , I have combo skin I started using this 2 years ago and never going back I have tried 5 different toners before this one and they either dried my skin or made me break out this is different the first week of using my skin cleared up and it was really hybridized it was awesome for the cold and dry Wisconsin winter but nice and refreshing in the hot summer 1010 , Got the vitamin C version and its soooo nice  super gentle but still exfoliating , This is a great tone I use this with my moisturizer It has a really nice fruity smell and the skin feels refreshed after putting this on Definitely recommend this one , Amazing I see why it always goes out of stock quickly I use this at night with my other Sephora skin care products and wake up with glowy skin , Shockingly good I bought this as an impulse buy while I was inline and who could resist the 3 price tag I honestly had low expectations for it but so far i am blown away The toner leaves my skin feeling extra clean and without drying it out It leaves a perfect canvas for makeup and use it at night after cleaning and exfoliating before moisturizing and apply serum Will definitely be repurchasing in the future , So I got these products in Vitamin E and B3 and for the price I must say they really took me by surprise I love the smell and the smooth effect it leaves on my skin which makes my makeup go on so smooth Has not caused any breakage on my skin and infact has made it even less dry then before I would highly recommend this product , I ADORE this tonic I use it as my first step when I do my morning skincare routine at my boyfriends It does contain fragrance so those with sensitive skin might not like it but it definitely helped control oil on my combo skin , I use this product after every shower and before applying moisturizer It really cleans my skin and opens my pores , Love it Works great as a morning toner And smells wonderfully , I bought the vitamin tonic because I have sensitive skin I never had issues with it Looking forward to try the other ones I put it on after washing my face with cleanser and pads , Works and smells great I use this in the morning and it is not stripping and I have found it to be somewhat moisturizing , i bought this as an afterthought in line bc the price was great and it smelled delicious ive been using it for about 4 months and still havent run out i noticed recently that my acne scars and hyperpigmentation have lightened up SO much and i was confused bc i wasnt actively using anything to target it then i realized it was this i love that theres no alcohol so it doesnt dry my skin out and that it never stings even though theres fragrance a great 6 investment 3 will repurchase , I dont always use toner so wanted a small bottle to try Nice Works well smells good leaves my skin feeling clean , I purchased the dragonfruit one it helps whenever my skin is horribly dry  tight it is nonsticky and non oily just like it states I didnt understand anything about a tonic I am honored to have made this purchase I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT This INSTANTYBRING YOUR SKIN BACK TO LIFE , TINY BUT MIGHTY When I ordered my first bottle of this vitamin tonic I got the Vitamin E in the green bottle I did somehow manage to get it half off and only paid 3 for it so was worth the gamble I chuckled at the size of the bottle when I first saw it There is a reason these stock photos have no size comparison ITS TINY Shockingly tiny I was a little disappointed by the size But I used it once in the morning and at night The bottle got me through a month Not bad I still have about a third left actually I just got this Vit C I wanted something to help the healing process for this spout of adult acne I have going yet still leave me glowing Im going to do the Vitamin C in my morning routine to make me glow and the vitamin E in the evening to hydrate and refreshed I think pairing the two will make my skin and me happy , I actually got the passion fruit vitamin C bottle It works wonders Ive only been using it for about a week and it got rid of my under eye bags and makes my skin glow I use cerave face wash then apply this to my face using a cotton pad then add some of the ordinary serum and lastly use the cerave moisturizer My skin is the best its ever been and I feel great , The toner is nice and doesnt irritate my skin The only issue with this is that it doesnt have clean ingredients , The product is great and does everything it says The only reason I dont give five stars is the size of the bottle I hace a skincare routine for day and night time lets just say Im very regular with my beauty regiment The thing is I have to get a new bottle once everything two week at least I really wish they would offer a bigger sized bottle as an option , love the vit e one nice gentle smell a bit sticky tacky when it dries down but I love the way it has made my skin feel love the feel going on very light weight easy to spread I would repurchase , love it I put this on before sunscreen and it makes a difference , This scent smell nice It absorb quickly into my skin , So refreshing I have combo acne prone skin that often looks quite dull I use this morning and night before applying moisturizer and Ive already noticed a huge difference just a week later My skin looks so much healthier it glows I would recommend this to anyone with any skin type Love it , Love it really good and light on my skin makes me feel fresh and no complaints about the price , Love this Gentle on skin and smells great Didnt make me breakout Really cant go wrong for the price , One of the best choices in skincare I ever made was picking this up I cant recommend it enough youll love it , This is a great way to get Vitamin C in your routine I use it every morning it works great as Im not a huge fan of Vit C serums Wish it came in a bigger bottle but will be repurchasing , Really love this tonic I can see a huge difference in my skin which is a lot smoother and feels refreshingDefinitely love it this is my second time purchasing it I got the pink bottle last time and will continue to do so And at 6 bucks Definitely cant beat the price , This does an amazing job in the morning Hydrates and keeps it ready for moisturizer and sunscreen , In my opinion this product smells soooo good and I love the way that it leaves my skin  , I am sorry I thought they sent me a sample size This is useless I will have to buy one every 2 weeks if it lasts that long Not even going to try it I do not have time to run out for toner every week or 2 , This stuff is so amazing its magic in a bottle i put mine in my skin care fridge I I bought all three and Im so happy with it I noticed immediate results even after just the first use Ive been using them for the last few weeks and Ive noticed a beautiful glow my skin looks and feels amazing I recommend 100000 and the price is good also , I use in the morning after washing my face I love it and I have seen impact visible impact it has had with 3 weeks of use I had some acne marks and the only addition to my routine was this Vitamin C tonic lotion the scars are less visible now , Love it Feels great on my skin after washingI use the C in the AM and the E at PM and follow with my fave moisturizer , I personally used to use the cucumber micellar milk water that they used to have and I will say in my experience with this product its very similar and a good dupe for the discontinued micellar water , Its the perfect price and perfect size for traveling I brought the B3 to destine Florida and it was everything I needed for my skincare , It is good for sensitive skin Does not burn at all The bottle is little small for the price , Tiny bottle  Its sized more like a deluxe sample but my fault for not noticing the ounces before I ordered Smells delicious spot on passion fruit scent I used for the first time today but as far as I can tell its fab I am using Inkey List Vitamin C serum and it has taken away the age spots on my face so I am using this in conjunction"
