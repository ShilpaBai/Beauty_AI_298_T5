product,review
lip balm 1,"I bought this lip mask after reading the reviews and the hype Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations as vaseline petroleum jelly works way better for me
My review title says it all I get so excited to get into bed and apply this lip mask I do see a difference because I suffer from dry cracked lips I drink a lot of water and apply lip balm daily but nothing helped until I started using this untiluntistafted usinf this
Ive always loved this formula for a long time I honestly dont even use it for night time I use it as an everyday lip balm I love the texture Gummy Bear is my second most favourite scent Grapefruit is the best in my opinion
If you have dry cracked lips this is a must have After a few weeks of use I have learned I will always have by my bedside I thought it was a little expensive but a little goes a long way It is worth the price
The scent isnt my favourite but it works great I put it on every night before I go to sleep and every morning I wake up with smooth moisturizer and soft Packaging is amazing as well
Ill give this 2 stars for nice packaging and lovely scent Upon initial application it feels very nice But as I continued to use it I noticed I was getting more and more blackheadsclogged pores and pimples around my lips I thought it was my Aquaphor but its THIS It also makes my lips even more dry than they initially were Disappointing around my
I use this at night or while Im putting makeup on Love the way I dont have to reapply it during the night Definitely a win
I love this stuff I first had the sample size from a Sephora Birthday gift and once I had run through it I knew it was a purchase I live in an incredibly dry environment great for macarons but terrible for my skin This lip mask helps to keep my lips from becoming too chapped
I purchased the Sweet Candy scent at my local Sephora and I am OBSESSED I will be honest the scent is a bit strong  but theyre all strongly scented My lips are so soft 1010
this product is a bit pricey but after using one scoop i figured this will take a LONG time to use up the whole container it smells so good and the container is so cute
I use this every night and morning and it works wonders This never fails to make my lips super hydrated The tint and shine to it makes it even a great lip gloss during the day
A little goes a long way Love the fragrance and works great as a night lip mask Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the price
Honestly I was so excited when I got this in the mail But unfortunately it is not worth the hype  I have boughten two of these full size and I went through them so quickly The ingredients are not very clean and this product made my lips so dry I wanted to like this product so bad as its so cute and smells nice But unfortunately it is a hard pass for me I will be sticking to my vaseline and aquaphor for now 
Does the gummy bear mask smell absolutely delicious Yes Does it do much for my lips overnight Nope They are dry and a little chapped in the morning I honestly have better luck with my vaseline lip therapy but I am still keeping the Laneige to use as a daily balm
I just got this a few days ago its amazing I love the berry scent  Its very hydrating and my lips are so smooth and glossy  My lips are always chapped and dry this has really helped"
lip balm 2,"am super impressed with this lip mask I use it at bedtime and wake up with soft lips I struggle with cracked and peeling lips every winter I also use it on top of my lip liner in the morning for a plumped soft look
I used to like this product until I found out it has BHT in it which is HAZARDOUS Please do your research on the ingredients and youll see this is horrible for you and your body especially if ingested
love this so much I use it everyone night and it keeps my lips so hydrated because they used to always be so dry and chapped 5 stars 100 recommend
Obsessed with this The first few days I wasnt seeing ton of results but after using it consistently for a bit my lips are no longer chapped I dont have to reapply chapstick throughout the day My lips also look fuller Wasnt excited about the price but a small amount works well
Ive been using for a couple months now and it seems great when you first apply however Ive seen no improvement in the long run Luis are still dry and peeling
I wanted to love this product so bad because of all the amazing reviews but it honestly makes my lips so disgustingly chapped Ive used other lip masks that this hasnt happened with and went back to try the laniege one again and it gave me chapped lips again"
