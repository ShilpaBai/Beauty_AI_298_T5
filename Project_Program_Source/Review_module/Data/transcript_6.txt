hey there everyone it's helen i'm the national artist for sephora collection and today i have my beautiful model sophie here with me we used all creamy based products to create this super youthful hydrated look so let's just dive right in and i'll show you how we got there okay so we are going to kick it off using the kvd beauty good apple foundation this is such a great creamy foundation and i'm going to apply it with the pro foundation brush number 56 okay you can get a really good amount of coverage right away and you can always sheer it out if you don't want that much coverage everywhere i love this foundation because it gives like such just this flawless like a creamy coverage how does it feel on it feels very moisturizing and just looking at it the color is really nice and color's gorgeous on you this color is beautiful this is number i think 30. yeah number three medium 30. oh my gosh this looks totally gorgeous on you it's so easy to just build it up wherever you need just an extra little bit of coverage that shears out and looks like skin everywhere else totally gorge okay so next we are going to use the benefit boing concealer this is as they say industrial strength so it gives major coverage for this concealer i am using the number 71 brush this brush is a little bit tapered so it gives like a really nice flawless effect to anything that might have heavier coverage and this concealer is in shade number two okay i'm starting out just where she needs a little bit more coverage so where it tends to get the darkest on people's eyes is just on this inner corner here and right where it's the most purple which is right in here and since i don't need as much coverage on her lid i'm just sheering it out a bit with my fingers okay and now i'm gonna do the other side so starting on this inner corner and just blending it into that foundation it blends really easily they both are kind of creamy and easy to work with and i'm working with any excess to just take off the redness on her lid and just a bit here to give it a little bit of a lift without it being shiny okay beautiful okay so now that we have given her tons of beautiful creamy full coverage foundation and concealer we need to add a little bit of shape back into the face so i'm going to use the makeup by mario contour stick this is amazing because it also is a cream but in a stick format so super easy to use have you ever used a contour cream no actually not one like this this one's really great because it has like almost a drier texture so it works really well with these like juicier creamier things that make things move so this is really going to stay put and because i'm using this shade in medium i'm actually going to use the number 56 brush because it's just as easy to use the same brush and load it up with some product and add some shape in there okay i'm going to have you turn just a little this way and you always want to blend upwards to really make sure you are giving yourself a carved out kind of cheekbone as opposed to doing downwards because you just don't want to drag the face down you want to give it a lift i love this on you it's so soft and pretty okay let's blend it upwards you got cheekbones for days do you normally use like a bronzer when you do any sort of contour sometimes yeah okay sometimes don't have much luck with it i like that this one's like a warm color it's easy to use yeah you can't mess it up it's not gray it has this really nice tone to it it's not too warm and not too cool i'm gonna give you a little bit of contour just up here because you're a little bit more tan on your forehead so we're just gonna blend that line just blend it down a little yeah this looks really really beautiful on you thank you all right now we need to add a little bit of color so i'm going to use the melt cosmetics cream blush this one is in the shade golden hour and it's really gorgeous i'm going to use it again with that number 56 brush i love how beautiful creams look on the skin i feel like my go-to is actually creams i do this every day almost always work with the cream they're just very forgiving it's easy if you're a beginner to apply any sort of cream you can't mess it up because you can just kind of mush it around and it'll be fixed so if you put way too much on you can kind of you know take it off with your fingers it's just a very flexible formula and what i like about it most is how glowy it makes the skin look so if you have any dryness or texture it just kind of hides everything because it looks so just polished and very pretty all right next i'm going to add a bit of highlight using the rare beauty liquid luminizer i'm just using my fingers here to just meld it in to the blush and foundation as well it just gives a really natural beautiful glow and taking a blank finger and just pressing against any edges to soften them that gives such a major glow oh my god move your chin up and down let's see come down okay we can do it on the other side here okay gorgeous and i really love this product because even though it's a liquid it has that same sort of easy texture you can blend it very easily with creams creams are great because they play well with others so they're great with liquids they're great with powders they're just really it depends on how you layer them but creams are really easy to work with all right and i'm gonna go in with charlotte tilbury cream eyeshadow and this is in the shade sunset rose and i love cream eyeshadows if you ever have an issue with fallout when you're doing a nice dark smokey eye start with a cream it's gonna give you the depth that you need but it also doesn't give you any fallout which is just awesome and they blend super easily so i am using a brush with this and i'm using a little bit of a lighter tone but these are just so flexible and easy to use you can use them underneath powders you can use them alone and i just love to apply any and all of these products in the morning i'm so lazy i just apply them everything with my fingers i feel like that is the best part about creams is that they are super flexible you can apply them with a brush you can apply them with your fingers you can apply them with a sponge they're just very flexible so if you have you ever used a cream eyeshadow yes i've used some glitter ones oh yes those are great too because glitter you always get like crazy fallout and this is just an amazing way to keep them really stuck to your lids instead of all over your cheeks huh and i really like this formula as well because i feel like it blends out really well and i feel like another reason why i really love a cream shadow is that they blend out so it looks like you're a pro no matter what you can always blend it out and make it look really soft on all the edges it just looks flawless no matter what as always with creams i like to lightly set them just where you have the hot spots so in the t-zone anywhere where you might get a little bit more oily but i also like to set underneath the eyes lately as well okay so i love how this turned out your makeup just looks so skin like it's really dewy and hydrated if you liked this tutorial please like and subscribe and until next time bye everyone you
