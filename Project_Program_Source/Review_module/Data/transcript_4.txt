[Music] hey there everyone it's helen i'm the national artist for sephora collection and today i'm joined by my beautiful model ray and we are going to do a matte complexion that is super long wearing of course everyone loves a dewy look but we're heading into the warmer months and sometimes you just need something to be matte and long wearing so let me just show you how to get the look all right and i'm going to kick it off with the sephora collection mattifying and refining primer this is just a great gel to cream primer that is going to just mattify in the t-zones everybody gets shiny in the afternoon so i love to use a primer strategically just to make the makeup last and a little bit goes a really long way so just a tiny bit work it between your fingers and then you can do right here where you get shiny and what i love about this primer is that it's really great for sensitive skin it doesn't feel tight on the skin it is going to mattify but it's very thin so it's just a really great overall way to start your makeup look feels very cooling right it feels cooling it's really nice it's like that witch hazel in it it's really beautiful all right next i am going to use the lancome taunty doll foundation this is a super long wear foundation and i love it because it gives this really beautiful effect for anybody who has dry skin which you had told me earlier that you have a little dry skin which i actually have that foundation exactly it's perfect so i love this because i feel like a lot of times matte foundations are really powdery and this works really well to smooth out the skin even if you have dry skin and it's really like nice full coverage right off the bat i'm using the number 47 foundation brush and i like this brush for dry skin too because it's flat so you're really using like painterly motions to make sure you're not brushing up any of the dry skin and it gives you just a really nice full coverage that brush is so soft it's so soft and i just feel like it really does like apply the foundation in a really smooth and beautiful way so you can see it's already giving her a little bit more of a mattified complexion and i'm gonna go in on the other side now it's interesting because what i like about how this feels is that it doesn't feel like i have barely for sure this foundation is gorgeous because it is really lightweight but it has that like full pigment tons of coverage um and is matte but looks really smooth but it doesn't look dry even though it's not for someone like me who is dry and here i'm using the shade 340 bisque and it's really important with this foundation to just make sure you test it on your skin just to see how it will dry down like paint you need things to just dry down and become their true color so this is just a really good foundation and make sure you test it that way all right next i'm going to just give her a little bit of concealer this one is from item beauty by addison rae this is the air hug concealer and it is in shade 230 it has a great nice applicator so you can get a really juicy application and a little bit goes a long way with this concealer so honestly just do a couple dots to start off and i'm going to use the number 71 brush and i'm just applying this where she has a little bit of darkness this is a bit drier of a concealer so definitely if you have dry skin i recommend prepping with a bit of eye cream and just making sure it feels nice and smooth and like i said a little bit goes a very long way so no need to apply a ton you can see it just brightens it up so i'm just applying a bit of the concealer on this inner corner here and some on this outer corner and blending it through this is just a really airy concealer hence why it's called air hug it has this really nice light texture and it dries down very matte but very smooth which is nice i love to use this on lids especially if you're going to go in with any kind of eye look it's kind of a great primer if you have any discoloration on your lid just brightens it up it's matte so it will not let your eyeshadow slide around just a really great prep and you can see this looks way brighter it's just really nice and the finish is super smooth and matte and then go ahead and the other side [Music] does feel very creamy though it is yeah it has a liquidy creamy texture which is nice it's easy to work with it's like the one product i can't leave the house without concealer concealer it's gotta cover those dark circles and mine's mascara so there you go like i gotta darken the lashes i do need two yeah concealer and brow gel concealer there we go i love it so you can see this just really makes everything look super polished and ready to go so i am done applying the liquids here you can tell that she has a beautiful polished mattified look but we are going to add to that with some powders let's dive in to the anastasia face palette i love this one because it has mostly matte options but has a little bit of shimmer if you need to add some more structure and shine to the face so i'm going to go in with this matte blush and i'm using the pro blush brush number 99 and just giving her a bit of color on her cheek right where that sun would hit give her that natural flesh and i like this formula because it builds really nicely so you can get a really soft look and then just keep building it if you want blush to be the focus of your look i'm going to use a little bit of this bronzer using the same brush a little bit goes a long way so i'm just gonna add a bit of color here and put a little bit on the nose and i love this because it really just gives you it's more mattifying but also gives you that sun kissed effect all right and now is where we're actually not gonna go for matte i'm gonna use a bit of highlighter that has shine to it i think it's super important when you're going for an all matte look to add a bit of shine and structure just to give your skin some life back to it so i'm going to use a bit of this highlighter just on the high points of her cheek i like this highlighter because it's a really soft highlighter so it's not going to be too contrasting against the [Music] matte gorgeous all right now it's time to set the makeup i'm going to use the sephora collection translucent setting powder and i am going to use the number 96 brush i feel like with a matte complexion look i always use setting powder it just gives you that really seamless look [Music] all right so i'm going to finish the setting process using the sephora collection setting spray this setting spray is no joke it makes your makeup last 16 hours so it really does make lock everything in and you know the warm weather is coming right up so this is great for if you live in a humid climate or if it's just really hot it's going to really just make sure that you have everything very matte and long wear for a long time this is for me the sun lover yes exactly the sun lovers out there use this it's great clothes and i do it in like a kind of like a whipped cream motion um and that just helps to like set it and make sure they don't spray all in one section okay ray are you ready to see yes wow oh my god how do you feel just you know i have to be honest whenever i hear the word matte i always think i'm going to end up like really dry or crusty but this is so perfect and seamless it looks so polished and it's it's beautiful and you probably didn't even know that that foundation is like such a beautiful matte finish no use it yourself it feels like hydrating but it's matte right exactly but it feels like there's hydration but without it being like too glossy exactly i love it okay so this routine is great if you are looking for a perfectly matte look i feel that with these products it's pretty universal whether you have dry skin or oily skin it's all going to work for you and if you liked this video be sure to like and subscribe and until next time bye
