[Music] hey there everyone it's helen i'm the national artist for sephora collection and today i have catalina with me and if you have oily skin i have the matte complexion of your dreams and this will really last all throughout the summer heat so let's get started okay to kick it off for oily skin you must prime so i'm going to use the sephora collection mattify and refine primer i love this primer mainly because it mattifies and refines your pores for 10 hours it looks so good on i wear it when i have like shoot days when i can't look shiny it works well with oily skin but it really works well with any skin type it's just a really great mattifying primer and it has witch hazel in it which is really great for your pores and it also has white tea extract so that really helps to fight against environmental factors so it's just a really great overall primer and i like to focus it pretty much just in the center of the face where you get the shiniest so starting off with a primer that will mattify will really just set you up to have mattified skin all day okay next up is our foundation and this is by lancome this is the tauntie doll ultra wear and it wears for 24 hours so it is a really great foundation if you have oily skin and products tend to like slip off your face this is a really really good one what kind of foundation do you normally wear so usually i stick with like a bb cream i just have such oily acne prone skin i just don't typically wear foundation but when i do i try to make sure it's matte yeah yeah this one's great because it's matte it's super long wearing i feel like it's full coverage but it feels very lightweight which is great okay um and i feel like it never will add any extra texture if anything i think it helps to kind of like blur things and really just cover any redness if you have acne but not because it's matte it's not going to enhance any texture it's really great feels good yeah and definitely for this one i would say just let it develop on the skin a little bit to get your perfect match okay a technique that i love to do wherever you want more coverage you can do a little like stippling action with the brush this is the number 56 brush so it's great for just strategically adding coverage where you want it it doesn't feel heavy which is nice i love this foundation because it truly gives like crazy great coverage and it feels like air so you can see that this is sort of drying down and becoming a bit more matte but it's a really natural matte so it's not too powdery which i love okay so now for a really long wearing concealer this is the hourglass vanish airbrush concealer i love this for under eye because it is radiant but it's also long wear so it has a 16 hour long wear claim on it which i love and i feel like if you're oily you still need radiance underneath your eye so this one is really great and this is in the shade flax and i am using the number 71 brush and we're just going to get right on in there do you use like a liquid concealer or cream yeah i'd use both um if i need really full coverage i use like concealer that's in a pot oh yeah um and i have liquid as well so i kind of switch it up switch it up yeah depending on what i need that day and you can see this is just such a nice radiance to it but really will last all night long no oily complexion would be complete without setting powder it's going to mattify and really set everything in place so this is the sephora collection translucent setting powder it's really nice and universal it's translucent works with most skin tones and i'm going to use it with the number 59 brush and if you're doing a full coverage look i like to do a rolling motion so you're not getting rid of any of that coverage but if you want to sort of blend everything out you can do a sweeping motion as well i like to focus the majority of the mattifying powder on the center of the face and then just use what's ever left on the brush on the periphery of the face so matte and it's so gorgeous okay so i did add a little bit of color i gave her some blush and a little bit of lip gloss but now we are ready to lock and load everything and i'm going to use the benefit cosmetics porefessional super setter spray this is essential if you have oily skin and you want your makeup to last so close your eyes and i like to do it in like a whipped cream motion it just kind of locks everything in and that way it's not all spraying it at once in your face close one more time and i like to do two little spritzes so this matte look is great if you have oily skin especially in the summer time it is really going to keep everything on and i feel like if you add up all of the hours that all of these products claim you could probably wear this you know until tomorrow morning and it would still be on it looks really great on you and if you liked this video be sure to like and subscribe and we'd love to hear what you're
