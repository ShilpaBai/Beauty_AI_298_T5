Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,"I bought this lip mask after reading the reviews and the hype Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations as vaseline petroleum jelly works way better for me , My review title says it all I get so excited to get into bed and apply this lip mask I do see a difference because I suffer from dry cracked lips I drink a lot of water and apply lip balm daily but nothing helped until I started using this untiluntistafted usinf this , Ive always loved this formula for a long time I honestly dont even use it for night time I use it as an everyday lip balm I love the texture Gummy Bear is my second most favourite scent Grapefruit is the best in my opinion , If you have dry cracked lips this is a must have After a few weeks of use I have learned I will always have by my bedside I thought it was a little expensive but a little goes a long way It is worth the price , The scent isnt my favourite but it works great I put it on every night before I go to sleep and every morning I wake up with smooth moisturizer and soft Packaging is amazing as well , Ill give this 2 stars for nice packaging and lovely scent Upon initial application it feels very nice But as I continued to use it I noticed I was getting more and more blackheadsclogged pores and pimples around my lips I thought it was my Aquaphor but its THIS It also makes my lips even more dry than they initially were Disappointing around my , I use this at night or while Im putting makeup on Love the way I dont have to reapply it during the night Definitely a win , I love this stuff I first had the sample size from a Sephora Birthday gift and once I had run through it I knew it was a purchase I live in an incredibly dry environment great for macarons but terrible for my skin This lip mask helps to keep my lips from becoming too chapped , I purchased the Sweet Candy scent at my local Sephora and I am OBSESSED I will be honest the scent is a bit strong  but theyre all strongly scented My lips are so soft 1010 , this product is a bit pricey but after using one scoop i figured this will take a LONG time to use up the whole container it smells so good and the container is so cute , I use this every night and morning and it works wonders This never fails to make my lips super hydrated The tint and shine to it makes it even a great lip gloss during the day , A little goes a long way Love the fragrance and works great as a night lip mask Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the price , Honestly I was so excited when I got this in the mail But unfortunately it is not worth the hype  I have boughten two of these full size and I went through them so quickly The ingredients are not very clean and this product made my lips so dry I wanted to like this product so bad as its so cute and smells nice But unfortunately it is a hard pass for me I will be sticking to my vaseline and aquaphor for now  , Does the gummy bear mask smell absolutely delicious Yes Does it do much for my lips overnight Nope They are dry and a little chapped in the morning I honestly have better luck with my vaseline lip therapy but I am still keeping the Laneige to use as a daily balm , I just got this a few days ago its amazing I love the berry scent  Its very hydrating and my lips are so smooth and glossy  My lips are always chapped and dry this has really helped , i love how hydrating this makes my lips feel perfect for an overnight lip mask or just a gloss as well lasts forever , Its super glossy and looks amazing but doesnt last very long after use , i have used this for about almost a year and my lips are so soft once i use this not only do i use it at night but just when i need a quick moisturizing pick up for my lips  , I have this in every colour except for sweet candy which will be my next purchase but I got the kit with the 5 minis for christmas and I honestly love these so much I wake up and my lips are instantly smooth I can also use it as a lipgloss and its honestly my favourite lip product ever , Theres nothing wrong with it but i think it was overhyped on tiktok It actually made my lips a little dry , Just like  Aquaphor just get something cheaper its just overrated Its good but they also animal test  , I just started using it but from the first night my lips felt way better The next morning they even looked fuller which Im not sure if thats the intention but still And the berry smell is so good , This lip balm is the best I ever had It works It hydrates and last long It has everything you need in a balm It even has a little spatula that you can use to scoop the product easily and cleanly , Not worth the hype My lips are still dry after using this product nightly  had much better results with the Ilia Lip Wrap and its a cleaner product , Super hydrating and smells really good unlike certain lip masks , i love this product it leaves my lips so hydrated and the colour is immaculate , i really tried to love this  i wore it to sleep every night for a month but every time i woke up with lips chapped and peelingoverhyped and not worth the money just use vasaline , Love this Im obsessed with the Gummy bear scent This stuff is so thick and creamy Lasts for hours  Very hydrating Loved it so much I bought the daytime gloss Candy also smells amazing , I love this lippyit makes my lips soft and also is helping my acne scars to fake and no idea why , dried my lips out sooooooo bad literally were cracked peeling and bleeding I stopped using it and it got better def do not recommend buying this , I used this product daily last week and my lips hurt I stopped using it and just used Aquaphor to heal them and they are doing much better I might be allergic to this product , I really loved this product and did use the whole thing it lasted over 6 months and I thought did a decent job The only problem is that I noticed part of my lip started to get super dry and no matter how much I used how frequently I reapplied exfoliated my lips it did not get better Nothing else in my routine changed except for adding this product in so this did cause my lips to dry out and didnt fix it Its not worth the price Vaseline works just as good and never dried my lips out , This product is amazing I use it before bed and also throughout the day as a lip balm Its so smooth and feels amazing It doesnt have a sticky feeling at all My lips are soft and smooth since adding this my routine I will definitively be purchasing again , In my opinion its very over hyped Its not very moisturizing I prefer Tarte Jelly Glaze over this and its also half the price which is the whole point Its not horrible but its not good either  Plus Im pretty sure they test on animals so that doesnt make me appealed to buy again , I almost want to wear this all day long Its so tasty and so pretty when its on The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star is because it doesnt really stay on long enough Definitely not all night long , It is so moisturizing and keeps my lips super soft and hydrated , I am super impressed with this lip mask I use it at bedtime and wake up with soft lips  I struggle with cracked and peeling lips every winter  I also use it on top of my lip liner in the morning for a plumped soft look , I used to like this product until I found out it has BHT in it which is HAZARDOUS Please do your research on the ingredients and youll see this is horrible for you and your body especially if ingested , love this so much I use it everyone night and it keeps my lips so hydrated because they used to always be so dry and chapped 5 stars 100 recommend , Obsessed with this The first few days I wasnt seeing ton of results but after using it consistently for a bit my lips are no longer chapped I dont have to reapply chapstick throughout the day My lips also look fuller Wasnt excited about the price but a small amount works well , Ive been using for a couple months now and it seems great when you first apply however Ive seen no improvement in the long run Luis are still dry and peeling , I wanted to love this product so bad because of all the amazing reviews but it honestly makes my lips so disgustingly chapped Ive used other lip masks that this hasnt happened with and went back to try the laniege one again and it gave me chapped lips again  , Ive never used this kind of product I tend to be very minimalist After 1 night I was already so impressed I had it mailed to a girlfriend as a gift as far as scents go if youre shopping online  all of the other ones are strong smells it all smells like 90s chapstick This one is milder easier to go to sleep next to someone imho , Dont waste your money I had gotten this as a sample and used it as the directions said it was very hydrating but overnight my lips were still dry itd supposed to hydrate my lips overnight Maybe Im just wrong , ive tried my friends a few times and it does good and smell nice but there are definitely dupes like the burts bee lip treatment that are much cheaper and as good , My lips were always so dry but this product made them so soft and hydrated I put it on at night but also during the day over a lip tint Love it , It works makes my lips soft so I dont need to use chapstick throughout the day Sometimes I use it as lipgloss instead of a night mask , Literally love all of Laneige products The lip sleeping mask has an amazing slip and its just the perfect overnight mask Not sticky at all , Ive had this lip sleeping mask for over a year now and it is the best overnight lip mask When applied to my lips it feels super soft and does not feel sticky When I wake up my lips are super soft and smooth 1010 get it now , So good I love the smell and I bought 3 times to use this product we can use this lip sleeping mask in half a year it is not expensive for 070 , Amazing My lips literally react so badly to every single lip balm or chapstick I had a allergic reaction to jack black spf lip balm and this saved my lips They are super soft and moisturized  , I use this every single night right before I go to bed and it leaves my lips super smooth in the morning , I have these in vanilla and sweet candy I use them every day multiple times a day They hydrate much better than standard lip balms and they last forever Ive definitely had them for over a yearthey they dont change in consistency or effectiveness , This product is amazing It really does smell likes gummy bears and leaves the best moisturizing feeling for a period of time Stays shiny like a gloss , This product is marketed as a sleeping mask but i would say its more of a lip balm It doesnt hydrate at all so dont turn to this looking to help dry lips It doesnt last long at all But it does look pretty on the lips is not sticky and has a really nice buttery texture Just wish that wasnt the only upside , This product is a DEFINITE must for chapped lips I get really chapped lips when Im stressed out especially in the winter and it saved my life , Love it Use it every night and it keeps my lips juicy throughout the whole day even in winter storms canada Highly recommend it tastes great too , Received this in the Sephora birthday pack Wanted to love this strawberry scented lip mask but it didnt do much for me Actually left my lips feeling a little drier I fine almost any other lip balm works better , after using this product for weeks it makes my lips feel very nice and you dont really need a lot at a time so for the price id say its worth it because u dont need to use that much it also doubles as a lipgloss , Ive been using this for over 2 weeks now and its sooooo good keeps my lips baby soft and it smells so nice and sweet too 1010 recommend , It keeps my lips so glossy  hydrated  You can use as lip gloss if you want too  , Je ne comprenais tellement pas pourquoi tout le monde se lanait sur ce produit jusqua ce que je lessaie moimme Il hydrate tellement bien les lvre il sent trop bon est nest pas dsagrable Perso je le porterais jour comme nuit avec mes lvres sches ce produit me donne limpression de renatre En plus il vient avec un petit applicateur donc pas besoin davoir le doigt tout gras en prlvent dedans Jadore Je ne pourrais plus men passer Il devrait toutes fois sortir plus dodeur qui sont plus douce , love her as a sleeping mask i dont think you could ask for anything better , really not worth it to be honest barely hydrates my lips so expensive and not cruelty free kinda worth it cause of packaging  i was so hyped when i bought save ur money and buy some aquaphor instead , Amazing product for dry lips It is a mask so you apply before bed then wipe excess in the morning It smells so good you just wanna chew your lips offI wont of course lol Great product for out of control dry lips like mine , Really like this product for before bed Its super hydrating and doesnt feel tacky The scents are great too , This is now my second time purchasing this product It is super hydrating also nice to wear during the day as well , Within just a few days of using this lip mask my dry lips from the cold dry winter feel so much better Not overly greasy and easy to sleep with it on , Love this lip masks so much I bought so many other flavours and if you have been thinking about getting it just buy it It is literally so good I would literally spend all my money on this Im not joking its literally amazing  , I think this is overpriced for what it is  lip balm It is nice though and when I apply it my lips feel nice Definitely a luxury and not a need , I love this product because it keeps by lips really hydrated in the cold weather , Received a sample and had to buy the full size immediately after I finished it Ive used a lot of Blistex and other chapsticks and I think this really helped heal my chapped lips Definitely recommend , I love this product so much I use it day and night Its so hydrating and its like a lipgloss  , Love the flavour et my lips are soft in the morning , I know this doesnt work for everyone but it sure works for me I use it at night and wake up to moisturized lips A big caveat is that if Im not drinking water ie that time I lost my water bottle for three days there is no amount of lip balm that will fix my dry lips Also if you like the Japanese grape flavour this is what the balm smells like exactly Which in my case is the perfect scenario Not greasy or sticky and no flavour if you eat it A little goes a long way imo so the price is a good deal for me , Ive repurchased many times make sure to keep spatula so you dont use your fingers so you dont get bacteria in it , I have a sample size of this product It is very glossy and looks nice when first applied Unfortunately upon leaving it on overnight I found my lips chapped in the morning and flaky , This has really helped my dry lips especially in the winter A must have in my routine , Mes lvres sont beaucoup mieux hydrates aprs seulement 1 semaine d utilisation  J ai essay un autre masque de nuit avant celui la mais il ntait pas efficace  En plus Laneige sent super bon  Lapp , not sticky looks like gloss but feels like a lip balm or butter I hate sticky lip products and i love this looks very pretty too , I dont see the hype for this product It doesnt work every time I use it just once in a while It gives my lips a nice glow and temporary hydration but not as a treatment or for long term results Would not repurchase , Didnt enjoy this product I got it as a birthday gift Ive only used it twice Both times it dried out my lips badly that it took a week to get better It left my lips more chapped than I began with was , This product smells good but that is basically the only good thing The lip mask feels like a weird bubble gum and looks identical to Vaseline when on your lips Maybe if this product wasnt thirty dollars dollarsit would be worth it but since its not I do not recommend it would be worth , I adore this product It is perfect for any time of the day I used to wear it only before I went to sleep and it would make my lips so soft by the morning Now I also use it as lip gloss during the day It makes my lips look very glossy and plump similarly to when I wear the Dior lip oils , Good product feels nice on the lips I wouldnt say that it is the most hydrating but it definitely looks good on the lips , Hydrating and smells super yummy Ill use this as a quick hydrator while Im doing makeup if I know Im putting on lipstick This little jar will go a long way Also love that it comes with an applicator , I took the sweet candy one I dont like it Bought it 2 months ago still have it , my lips have been dry and flake for as long as i can remember i finally got this and aquaphor and finally noticed a difference in one night my lips were smooth and every since then have not flaked , This product is so cute especially with the little applicator for your lips It keeps my lips hydrated really good and I absolutely love this product  , I love the feeling of all of lanieges lip masks and was so excited to try this one Yummy candy but not too overpowering , I use this night and morning and LOVE it This tub lasts SO long too , its good i like it it lives up to the hype nothing more nothing less also why tf are we spending 24 on lip balm lol  , I love LANEIGE but i dont think this is worth 30 it is rlly good but i would wait for a sale or get it cheaper online , good for use all day not just for night made my lips sooo soft , I love everything laneige and this is no exception Living in the Midwest in the winter this has literally SAVED my lips from being cracked and sore all winter , Its the holy grail of lip hydration I dont love the applicator though and feel like it could easily be in a tube instead , its nice but buy the amazon dupe Also the application is a bit difficult They have one with the squeeze tube thats better , I dont understand the hype its definitely not work the money Doesnt stay on very long and doesnt make a difference in hydration The vanilla left a film after use Only good thing is the smell , Im the type of person that bites and picks on my lips constantly and I decided to give this products a try and  apply it the second I go to bed Few days my lips have never felt so soft , Obsessed Ive used the Berry Mango and Gummy Bear scents and I love them I use every night and can still feel them on my lips in the morning A definite must have , I tried it first from the mini version Sephora gifted and I loved it so much that it inspired me to get the full version But what Ive noticed after using it for quite some time is that it stopped really working Maybe the mini version is more concentrated but overall its a great product , Truly nourishing and very sexy wet look too I use it before going out during winter days , I really wanted to love this but I ended up just liking it It does hydrate but its not the absolute best out there I would recommend the berry flavor as opposed to the vanilla flavor The vanilla just tastes odd , This feels and smells nice but over time it dried my lips out more than any other lip balmmask Ive ever put on my lips My lips were literally peeling after using this for a few weeks and Ive never had that happen to me before , I think its worth the price because Ive been using it for about a year and I still have some even though I put a lot on at night and sometimes during the day It works really well for me and lips feel so soft and moisturized when i wake up , i loveeeee this mask it instantly makes my lips hydrated and i wake up to smooth soft lips a little goes a long way and this will definitely last a while i definitely recommend , Love So moisturizing and cute Love putting it on before I go out or before bed and it leaves my lips feeling soft for hours , Love this product I use it at night and wake up with hydrated lips smooth and plump Best lip mask Ive ever used , This is awful and feel bad my daughter bought me this for Xmas It does not moisturize my lips at all Wish I could get a refund since she wasted her own money on this , Ive used this every night for 3 months and I still have so much product left I can still feel it on my lips in the morning and its left feeling super soft Its a staple in my skincare routine 3 , Ive been using this product for years and love it The peppermint has a nice tingle and smells amazing 100 will repurchase if it comes back , Excellent produit  Lapparence de mes lvres a chang aprs 1 semaine dutilisation Plus hydrates moins rouges et plus uniformes , The winter time always leaves my lips dry but when you add wind and freezing cold temperatures my lips become chapped and irritated Laneige has become a staple in my makeup bag In fact I have one in my purse and in my car as well I saw a difference in just using it a few times It deeply hydrates my lips I feel relief instantly No more chapped lips for me I highly recommend this product All of the scents are great Gummy bear is my favorite , Ive been using this for 3 months and it has saved my dry cracked lips my lips are always sore bleeding and cracked after using this I have been waking up with really soft lips 1010 , Meh I mean its ok I like the Fenty skin one better and this one is super pricey for what your getting I got the grapefruit and it smells really good though , I live with this mask on my lips all winter long I live in a cold dry environment and most lip balms and chapsticks dont help I apply a thick layer of this lip mask on nightly and some days I will apply it throughout the day and I havent experienced chapped lips at all this winter It has even saved my lips when Ive forgotten to use it for a few days and have had chapped lips that require repair , love the initial application because it layers so well on your lips and feels hydrated But after 2 uses it began making my lips feel all chapped Better off with vaseline , Highly recommend  It works great especially after exfoliating my lips I use it as a gloss during the day and smells great , I received a sample of this lip mask with my order and OMG it got rid of the hyperpigmentation on my lips after only one use , ive had this product for about 3 months now and let me tell you i love it it makes my lips super soft in the morning the scent is also amazing definitely , I decided to give this lip treatment a try back in August 2022 First I have been using it every night for the last 6mths and I have barely made a dent in it Second I usually use Blistex at night and throughout the day to keep my lips hydrated and protected from Canadian winters Since using the sleep mask at night I rarely have to use my Blistex As far as bang for buck goes  I highly recommend This is an excellent product , This has saved me during dry cold Canadian winters I am prone to dry lips that could even crack when left untreated in the winter This mask has helped keep my lips soft during the dry months of the year , This product is pretty good and it moisturizes my lips well My only issue is the taste and smell is kind of artificial Great product though , Pros Made my lips very smooth Smells amazing Cons is a little pricey Test on animals But I would recommend , After using the entire product I am not impressed with how much the product dissipates once applied to the surface of your lips I like it for the thick shine and smell but thats about it Would not recommend it , Amazing luxurious  yummy lip masktreatment Hands down the best lip treatment ever , I use this every single night I wake up with the softest lips ever , It is a good lip sleeping mask and I use it every night It helps reduce itchiness around my lips during day time , I LOVE this product I use it every morning and night It may be kind of expensive for a lip balm but mine has lasted for over a year I just wish they made it in a stick form so I didnt have to put my finger in it and it would be easier to use on the go , I LOVE THIS SO MUCH so hydrating lasts super long and generally a great product BUY THIS , First night I used this I thought it was overrated second night I woke up with new plump hydrated lips Worth it , I heard amazing things about this so I got it and it was amazing , Using this every night has literally transformed my lips  I no longer need constant hydration throughout the day I just grab some of my fave lip balm as needed Also gummy bear is the BEST smell , I have never found a product that helps my lips like this Ive been using it for a year now and it is a LIFESAVER I have tried so many other lip masks including just plain Vaseline and nothing compares Highly highly recommend lasts for a very long time too , Love this stuff it has saved my lips I wear it every night and my lips still feel soft in the morning , This is a great nighttime and daytime balm The smell is great and the balm is so hydrating without being sticky My fave for treating chapped lips , I used to love this product Because it feels amazing at first However now I realized that its not very long lasting on the lips theres definitely better alternatives like the summer Fridays lip butter Fenty lip mask I have to admit I do love getting the limited edition once every year , I would not repurchase as there are better ones out there It dose work at keeping what moisture I have in my lips but dose not add any which really sucks , Absolutely love this line I usually do the original or the gummy bear I always wear this before bed and right before I walk out the door to start my day Its hydrating and I havent found anything that is as comfortable and hydrating Its not sticky and the smell is lovely not too over powering , 1010 I recommend this so much I was dehydrated and chapped and this gave my lips a complete transformation I use a decent amount at night and i use a thin layer during the day in place of chapstick , Feels nourishing nice for sleeping but can still be worn as a lip balmgloss during the day The vanilla scent isnt as yummy as I was expecting and doesnt last I usually love vanilla but I think the fruity scents are much better , i first didnt understand the hype around this product when i tried it at the store but i decided to give it another chance and i really enjoy it now you get a lot of product for the price and has an amazing sweet vanilla smell , Its not bad but does nothing more than a 1 lip balm , I used this over the course of a couple of nights  its basically just a lip balm Which feels good on my lips But it did nothing for me overnight  it wasnt worth 22 so Im exchanging it for fenty , Smells so good Automatic difference once applying this product on dry lips , great product I put this on every night and wake up with hydrated lips , I know everyone loves this lip mask and I do too but after trying the Lawless Forget the Filler sleeping lip mask I dont find this la neige option totally 5 stars anymore The consistency of this lip mask is a bit thicker and stickier and takes longer to really sink into your lips It does however leave them feeling super smooth and I like the little bit of color the Sweet Candy option provides All and all a great product but there is better out there , I like this product overall I find that moisturize my lips and keeps them hydrated but I will say that I am very disappointed to find out that this brand tests on animals  , I got this as a gift for secret santa and after using this product for a couple of days Ive found that it doesnt moisturize my lips as much as I would like The applicator gets musty and gross after a few uses unless you wipe it down after each use which can be a hassle Overall I dont think the Laneige masks are worth the amount of hype theyre getting I love the smell and texture though and it comes with a lot in it Its a sweet strong scent Im giving it three stars because Im not sure how I feel about it , I love this product as t moisturizer my lips perfectly I have  really dry lips as well i have a problem in heat that my lips start swollen But if i used it my lips dont dry out for almost 78 hours So love it , i bought the peppermint one back in october and have been using it about every other day since in my opinion it doesnt work that well it felt nice when putting on but i dont think it actually hydrated my lips for some weird reason i started using the clairins lip oil while it is a lip oil and not a lip mask my lips have felt significantly more hydrated and plump since i first started using , I literally love this lip mask It smells so good and it moisturizes my lips so well For me a must have , I bought a mini version of this just to try and I regret it because i am ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with this product and will now have to buy it all the time Really recommend , Ive been using this product for a couple days and I love it but when I go to sleep with it I get acne around my lips i dont know if Im allergic or something , I wanted to love it Made my lips worse no matter what I did Not worth it honestly Only positive is it smells nice , This product feels great when you first apply it but I think its overhyped I noticed my lips got drier whenever I reached for this product It smells good but its essentially a gloss in a jar , I love this product I have been using it every night for the past 5 years and I feel like it has made such a difference , I bought this lip mask almost a month ago and am already almost out because of how frequently Ive been using it My lips use to be crusty now they look much healthier and feel smoother Ill be buying again , Jadore la texture mais le produit sen va rapidement , I really wanted to like this but it really drys out my lips when I wake up in the morning plus it clogged pores around my mouth Dont believe everything you see online , I received a sample with a previous order and gave this a try Wow I wasnt expecting much but this has made a huge difference in my lips I use it right before bed and its like first aid for my skin The smell is pleasant and a little goes a long way I love the little silicone applicator that comes with it Everything about this little baby puts it over the top Love it and highly recommend , I love these This i"
Lip Glowy Balm,"Wonderful to add for day time in addition to the sleep mask Keeps the hydration going throughout the day I add onto of my lipsticks replaced all my lipglosses with this as its just as shiny , Definitely keeps my lips moist and glossy but the real best thing is the scent Ive never had a lip balm that has smelled this good before I havent tried the other scents but this grapefruit is an A , I love how hydrating this product is also love the smell and the subtle pink tint it has I need like 10000 of these Im obsessed , this products is just okay in my opinion the scent is amazing and smells soo good but this products is not long lasting whatsoever 20 mins after i apply this it is completely gone it does give a nice shine though if you are looking for some th bing lost lasting this is not for you , Ive been using this product for a year now and I absolutely love it It leaves my lips hydrated and looks as though Im actually wearing lip gloss And I love the scent , so glowy and makes my lips so hydrated its pricey and doesnt come with a lot of product but its so good i will buy again , I usually use the small tubs and I absolutely love them They are hydrating and can turn dry chapped lips overnight for a plump and hydrated finish The tube however I think for better flow has a different formulation It does not offer the same hydration and repair as the tubs Good product but youre better off purchasing the tub than the tube , doesnt last long but it feels really nice and my lips were so moisturized i would get again sadly i lost this while it was full and im still so mad at myself for it haha , This is one of the best balms Ive tried It hydrates my lips so well AND it smells amazing Its not sticky and is very light on the lips I definitely recommend , So I bought this over the winter December  I loved it It smoothed and hydrated my lips  its smells so good Its march now and I still have it I did a quick Sephora run and saw that they had the gummy bear 1010 not sticky , Jadore  Il sent bon gote bon et hydrate parfaitement Je veux toutes les sortes , this product is amazing you barely need to use any and it just melts right into your skin but you have to use it a couple of times to smell the yummy peach smell overall great product , A wonderful lip product It feels so nice on the lips and is super moisturizing The grapefruit and the other scents have a super cute super nostalgic 2000slipgloss smell and the tube totally makes me miss the 2000s too It also looks very subtle and pretty once applied  , i bought this bc i love the lip sleeping mask and this is more convenient i love it its so cute and so easy to use great purchase for a good brand like this , Great for on the go and has a very helpful applicator which is nice instead of getting your hands all sticky , my favorite I use this multiple times a day so nice to have an on the go option , je ladore hydratant belle petite teinte Je vais racheter et racheter , It hydrates the lips amazingly However it would have been perfect if the color was more prominent  , This keeps my lips so hydrated I have the lip masks in the container but this one is so much easier to use and works just as well , moisturizes my lips wonderfully but after a while becomes slightly sticky scent also lasts a while after application which we love overall a great product , Its meh Looks nice feels good on the lips Nothing outstanding Not really worth the money Aquaphor is better Nice as a lipgloss tho It also smells like the pink bubblegum tasting medicine that youd get at a child  , this is so incredibly moisturizing I use it all day every day it adds a perfect shiny gloss to the lips without being sticky and gross and above all that it smells so good , Perfect lip balm for hydration Keeps your lips moisturized Berry is the best shade for no makeup look , makes my lips so soft and moisturized personally for me grapefruit is the best out of all of them the fruity smell is amazing , When I say this is one of the best lip balms Ive ever tried in my life Im not joking Im extremely picky with my lip balms I hate the feeling of a lip balm being sticky not moisturizinghydrating enough or just feels like Im constantly reapplying product that disappears so quickly It is not sticky at all you can put it on your lips without putting Vaseline as a base The scent is amazing and does not give me a headache and I constantly reach for it M I would say I would like a bit more product in the tube for the price but other than that this lip balm is officially in my holy grail of lip products , I really love this its better than the big tube and its not sticky I recommend buying this , Jadore le fini sur les lvres lodeur est wow Je le rachterais dans toute les couleurs , When i got this product i was amazed right afterIts very hydrating and moisturizing1010  , It is perfect and worth the splurge It is super hydrating and looks like a gloss whilst giving the benefits you would get from a balm Also it smells amazing Worth it , It is Moisturizing and not sticky It Smells amazing , This is a mix of lip balm  and lipgloss for me Super moisturizing has a sweet berry taste last a really long time with the hint of colour I absolutely love , This is a beautiful and hydrating lip balm I got the grapefruit and peach and I honestly believe that they live up to the hype will definitely continue purchasing this item , I have been using this in the overnight live mask for about a month now and I love the look tastescent and tint I got peach in the lip float balm and it has subtle flavor and tint which doesnt taste extremely artificialI would recommend to people with not extremely dry lips who just want to make them softer , I have been using this product for about two weeks now I bought it because I loved their lip sleeping mask but this is a No for me Its a pretty glossy look but it does not hydrate my lips and comes off so fast  , Im a student and I always have this on me In the winter my lips get really dry and this helps with just that My lips get super soft and the shine on this is really good I really recommend this , a bit expensive in my opinion however its a very nice product in my experience Leaves a beautiful glossy finish on the lips makes them feel silky and isnt sticky at all Packaging is cute too , So moisturizing and smells so good I always get compliments on how nice my lips are and how smooth they are and I always say say that to my lip balm Lol I love it , A must have for keeping your hydratation of your lips and if you lost your gloss this produce can replace because hes glossy and comfortable not sticky , Hate how expensive this is but I cannot do without it I have really dry lips and this is the only thing that helps , its pretty hydrating but way too sticky the summer fridays lip balm is way better or the laneige lip sleep mask , Ive been using this product for a few weeks now and I am so in love with it Its so hydrating for my lips After application it stays on for hours at a time when Im not eating I dont have to constantly reapply which is a major upgrade from other lip balms Ive used before I will be buying again , I love the lip masks but these are so nice and easy to apply during the day the hydration actually lasts and make your lips look healthyplump , Not worth it the hype Its not hydrating at all and just sits on your lips Also sticky on my lips the smell is nice but thats about all I dont recommend theres better options , This product is a game changer Ive been using it for roughly 2 months now and have seen such an improvement with my chapped lips I have tried several other products and wasnt satisfied with the formula I paid this with the overnight balm and my lips have never felt better Not sticky at all the smallest amount goes a long way For the price point as well its a great price for such a rich formula , I love this lip product Its not overly sticky or a sickly sweet smell The peach is a light yummy fragrance The slight pink tint is perfect , My lips have needed this I was on the fence because of the price and the social media hype but after biting the bullet I am thrilled that I did The scent is nice and a little on the grape candy side but mild enough even if youre not a grape lover I find it to be super glossy and hydrating My chapped lips from the winter months are looking and feeling great after four days of use  Very happy and will be trying the other colors , I love this product to use along with the sleeping mask during the day Love the scent but sometimes i wish there was an unscripted version of this , I love the smell of this lip balm and for me it is hydrating and leaves a nice shine that isnt too shiny on my lips I feel like Aquaphor works just as well for less but Im still going to repurchase this , I love these lip balms I have the Gummy Bear and Berry and use them all day everyday , Made my chapped lips become healty and soft after only one day of using it , Best lip balm ever  I have gotten so many of these I tried all the flavours I love it so moisturizing lip leaves your lips feeling amazing Highly recommend dont sleep all this product  , Best lip balm Ive ever tried The formula is really moisturizing , Very hydrating and lasts a long time but the flavor is like someone yelled peach from the other room Very very very faint taste of peach Doesnt smell like peach at all Kinda disappointed but will still give 4 stars bc good quality for lip balm , I have been a faithful Burts Bees lip balm customer for years Always preferred it to Chapstick But the Laneige lip balm is amazing My lips always feel hydrated And the soft glow from a touch of color make it a perfect lip balm Get it in every color , Something about these lip balms I hate It gives me a headache and its greasy and overpowering to me , Ive had this product for a while and every time i use it it leaves my chapped lips feeling great i dont have the lip mask just this i love the way it feels its not sticky and the smell isnt strong but nice and subtle however it isnt tinted on my lips which is fine  it still passes as a gloss , I have had this for around two weeks and it has done nothing but dry out my lips It does nothing to help and just adds layers of what feels like old bubble gum , After a week of using it my lips are never dry and I love it so much , after using this product my lips dried out and it did not last long wouldnt recommend , My lips resume being soft within one night of using this product Works like magic I use the grapefruit flavor , This lip balm does not help my dry lips at all and is not hydrating It goes on nicely but dries up in minutes and I have to constantly apply Not worth it , Jadore vraiment ce produit il fait des lvres magnifiques et brillantes , Love the pop of color and the formula is not sticky at all 1010 , I really wanted to love this lip balm  I love the lip mask  However the lip balm was thinner did not add any color or glow and did nothing for my dry lips  I couldnt justify spending the amount of  on it  So I returned it , I have both the peach and gummy bear scent They are incredible The fragrance isnt too heavy but its delicious on your lips They look so shiny and glossy after putting it on and it lasts a very long time even through eating and drinking I recommend this to everyone , This balm is hydrating and long lasting  I love it , My absolute favourite lip balm ever It lasts so long and is so moisturizing I have dry skin and this is one of the only ones that lasts for me , Ive tried all the laneige masks and balms the gummy bear flavourcolour is by far the prettiest and smells the best The formula is great and soft , Super moisturizing for my lip No lie this lip balm is a best seller for a reason The gummy bear flavor is def my fave , This is the best lip product one ever used but the company tests on animals , My lips are finally hydrated Smells so good a god send product , First review ever because i love this balm so so much I have one for every bag and use it as a gloss since it gives such a hydrating shine and is the only gloss that doesnt crust up in the corners by the end of the night lol , i absolutely LOVE this product i will be buying this over and over again Feels so smooth and not sticky on lips also has a very soft tint and a perfect subtle scent  , Such a gummy bear scent  I keep it in my purse for a quick little gloss and hydration , I love the sleeping mask and was needing a new daily lip balm This

it ASAP , i love how this smells my boyfriend loves it to  i have to keep this in my purse it moisturizes so well , I love this product it leaves my lip soft moisturized and slightly glossy I keep at least 3 car nightstand purse Would definitely recommend , So good Highly recommend It is a lip balm but looks like gloss the best of both worlds , flavour and tint are great i wanted an alternative to the glossier balm dot com because the new formula felt less moisturizing this balm is super smooth and moisturizing and the packaging is so cute , LOVEE THIS BALMi would put this on and it will stay on for an hour , At first I loved this product Made my lips look great not sticky and hydrating But the hydration and shine lasts for maybe 30 min After that you have to reapply After a while of use it made my lips even more dry form the scent crazy intense bubblegum that I did not like Overall not worth it even though I tried hard to like it , Bought this product after trying the gummy bear sleeping mask which i loved The sleeping mask wasnt very convenient to carry around so i bought this as an alternative to keep in a makeup bag backpack etc and its great for everyday useeveryday use keeps lips hydratingpurseetc , I love the way it makes my lips feel I definitely would recommend , Its very good  It last long and repairs my lips even better than the lip mask  I love the smell its not too pink and the pricing is pretty good , This product is a perfect everyday balm that has a glossy look to it I love how hydrating it is I also really like that it does not feel sticky or tacky on my lips like some lip glosses do It pairs really well with my lip sleeping mask from this brand leaving my lips hydrated 247 Its a little pricy but in my option its worth it , Nothing special not worth the price Nothing wrong with it but definitely influenced and not impressed , I love this product I will always repurchase it Lasts long and its good pricing MY FAV , I have been wanting to try this for a while because everyone seems to love it In my opinion this is the equivalent of children lip balm It smells like you bought it at the dollar store and it doesnt last very long It does feel nice on the lips when you put it on but for the price price just go buy a tub of Aquophor , so expensive nd dosent last long but love it sm and smells yummy , I just got this product today and I love it At first I got the other version and thought it was annoying that I had to dig my hands into the container This tube is amazing for traveling and extremely moisturizing  long , Long lasting and hydrating formula It leaves a barely there tint which I love It gives a very soft pink glow but as a guy it doesnt make me feel like Im wearing a lipgloss or tint , I literally love this It smells so good and leaves the perfect shine on my lips Definitely going to try of the flavors , super nourishing and feels very nice i would say its better than the sleeping mask and i love how it comes in a tube , Smells so good Not my goto for hydration but gives a nice glossy look , I decided to give this a try even though the mask is drying and Im glad I did This stuff smells so good and feels amazing going on Lips feel hydrated and not sticky , ALLIYAHFACE RECOMMENDED THESE AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT I need all , Love this gloss Long lasting Love pairing it with any lip liner keeps my lips moisturized and glossy Not sticky at all , I really like the peach one It works really well and feels nice , Such an amazing lip balm I love how it feels on my lips and is perfect to put in my purse , for the price I really wanted something better its hydrating and smooths lips but dosnt last long I dont like how the color looks on my skin to , Im really picky with lip balms I usually use First Aid Beauty Lip Repair but they had been sold out of it instore for well over a month and as I was checking out I saw the Laniege in a lip balm that I had never seen before and thought why not try it because I was a little desperate at this point  Well Im glad the universe aligned me with this guy because its amazing love the soft glow on the lip the grapefruit is incredible and maybe one of the reasons I love it so much but it does keep your lips moisturized and no longer peeling , I have been using this lip balm for quite a while and I absolutely love it Its lightweight hydrating and provides a slight tint to my lips Its not as long lasting as I would like but I will continue to purchase because it has helped my lips from becoming chapped this winter Its also free of phthalates and parabens I would 100 recommend this product to others , It is truly such a great product because your lips and I shine and it has an I scent to it , SO moisturizing and smells amazing It looks really pretty on too , Kind of a miss for me Although the texture is nice it dries out quicker than expected The scent isnt great and overall isnt worth it for the price , One of my favorite lip balms I use day and night It gives my lips so much hydration , It smells so good and the color is cute Didnt think I would like it as much as I do , I love the LANEIGE lip balm But I seem to find that it will disappear on my lips after a few minutes I still would recommend this to you if you are looking for a good tasting lip balm and hydrating lip balm , Product is nice but too expensive for that amount , love its exactly like the lip mask but in a tube super convenient for day use its not as messy , My friend convinced me to buy this and its very hydrating Tho sometimes it feels a little extra gummysticky but other than that its perfect for everyday use  , I am in love of this product  It moisturizers the lips  gives nice lips  for me  Its so worth it  , I love using this product The slight colour is perfect and the applicator is amazing It leaves the same glossy finish as the Laneige Lip Mask but slightly less sticky , Ordered this out of pure peer pressure but still I was intrigued I tried the lip mask a few years ago but I didnt like it with this I had some hope But when I applied it it felt as if it was sitting on top of my lips and not sinking in Wouldnt recommend sticking with my Summer Fridays lip balm , Love this balm So hydrating without feeling sticky Looks great with or without makeup and smells amazing , The product smells really good  it feels good when its on the my lips  helps with hydration while its on but I find I need to constantly reapply it to keep it hydrated Not a bad price but the bottle is smaller than expected , I love the gummy bear one it smells amazing I also have the peach one which smells like nothing They are both really hydrating lip balms but Im disappointed by the peach scent , This balm is soo good It so glowy shiny and not sticky at all It leaves a nice subtle tint on the lips which i love , This is not as moisturizing as the mask It also doesnt last long on the lips , The peach smell is so good It smells kinda like peach ring candy It lasts long on my lips and makes them very hydrated The packaging is also very cute and simple Would definitely recommend , Love this Super hydrating and so cute A little pricy for how much product but its worth it for me , Believe the hype Ive been waiting weeks to get this and finally was able to buy it in store It has the same consistency as the sleeping mask but love that I can carry it on the go , The smell and the packaging are the only two good things about this product Massively overhyped it tastes like chemicals and doesnt feel hydrating Skip it , I love this lip balm but you should probably get the lip sleep mask because it lasts longer on this lips and the product in the container has more for like 3 extra dollars , Its good but I would honestly buy the sleeping mask again before I bought this , I love this its moisturizing and not sticky I cant believe I waited so long to get this I use the sleeping mask but this is fantastic to throw in your purse or pocket to use on the go goIdefinitelgetting more , Not a big fan Wouldnt Recommend use in the winter A nice pretty gloss but not for hydration purposes Does smell nice , its very cute with cute packaging and adds a little color and shine that look nice however is it VERY sticky and doesnt feel super moisturizing ill use the rest of it but probably wont repurchase , This is a lipgloss that I will always repurchase I am seriously so obsessed with all the laneige lip products but the duo of the berry lip sleeping mask and the glowy balm just mean so much to me I love the berry flavor The balm can be difficult ish to squeeze out of the tube when its cold out but just warming it up in my pocket always works I honestly prefer to put it on when its cold because the application feels more even When it gets too warm its kinda slippery , a lot of lip glossesoils are overpriced rn so this is a good affordable alternative , Good product Pretty color nice and hydrating I do think there are cheaper options just as good , I really like the texture and color and my lips get really soft after using the balm , Not sticky and the shade looks great Small enough to fit in any purse and the cap makes sure that nothing gets wasted , Excellent product Keeps my lips hydrated and has an incredible smell I have to use it at least three times a day for it to work but its been two months and Im halfway through Will repurchase , I have multiple and it honestly replaced my chapstick This is the only thing I use on a daily basis Keeps my lips so soft and smooth and the fragrance is not over powering Gives a nice gloss tint No stickiness , Bought this thinking it might be the same as the night mask one Plus i thought it would easier to put on then the night mask as its just a tube you glide on your lips vs having to use a lip applicator or my finger to put it on First off its not like the night mask one Its a lot thinner and wetter in texture I honestly love the night mask one more and used that as my everyday gloss This one left my lips feeling super dry once it came off After using it for a few days once it dried off my lips felt super chapped and dried Save your money and buy the night mask version , I was so excited to receive this product as I LOVE the Laneige lip mask but dont get it twisted This is not that This lip balm is 3x as scented as the lip mask it leaves the berry taste in your mouth mouth for a hot minute ewe  is significantly less moisturizing I will not be repurchasing  am actually tempted to return this product , As someone who uses the lip mask religiouslyand MUCH prefers this type of applicatorI had higher hopes for this balm Its just fine Doesnt wear particularly long or do anything earthshattering for my lips For the price I think there are much better options out there , I did not like this product after using it it would leave crusts on my lips Not buying again , I am on my second tube of this My favorite lip balm I have EVER had I love they berry flavor I received the peach as a Christmas gift I dont find myself reaching for it as much I put this on before bed and in the morning while Im doing my makeup Keeps my lips hydrated , I have had multiple shades but regardless of the shade I have enjoyed these very much  They look glossy and stay on the lips for a decent amount of time  They moisturize my lips decently too  I live in a humid climate all year round so Im not sure how these would hold up in a dry winter climate , very sticky and lasts only a couple minutes the sleeping mask is great but not this product , this is definitely worth the hype it leaves ur lips so glossy and hydrated but isnt sticky at all the grapefruit one is my favourite bc of the scent and the slight tint it has , It keeps my lips so hydrated through out the day it has a small tint and nice smell ive been using it for 4 months and its a must have its not sticky i usually out in over a light lip balm and it works out so nice they have confirmed they ARE cruelty free , Smells like candy and it feels really good and hydrating Would 100 recommend this , Worst product ever Useless it is I would never recommend this product , One of my favourites Its moisturizing has a light lint and it smells AMAZING , This product is amazing I love the brand Laneige and this lip balm is great The smell is exactly what it says and the packaging is very pretty Leaves my lips glowing , I have been suffering from dry skin during the winter and this has been a life saver for my lips I also like how the balm comes in a tube and thus is more hygenic because Im not putting my fingers into a pot The only con is that it is a pretty small tube so I have to be cautious and not waste any product and apply sparingly , I pair this gloss with most of my lip combos First winter yet that I havent had dry flakey lips No irritations from cracks looks good with most neutral combos Love it , Love these They go on really nicely and smells great Are more glossysticky feeling than the lip masks but just as hydrating Favs are grapefruit and peach , Really not a peach scent Almost no scent at all I love the berry and gummy bear but I wont buy this one again , I got this in peach and the taste is not over powering Its not sticky either which I cant stand , Literally the best gloss you could ever purchase It keeps your lips so hydrated All the colors are subtle but still have just enough touch of color The different scentsflavors are all amazing as well , Cant live without this one of my fave lip balms the gummy bear smells so good and its not sticky at all , Feels super good on my lips Soft and hydrated The only issue is the peach does not smell like peach , It is a bit pricey but one of my favorite products kept my lips Extremely hydrated when skiing for multiple days , This product smells amazing and I use it everyday when I wake up and it keeps my lips nourished for the rest of the day , I bought this on a whim and was greatly disappointed the only thing this lip balm does is smell nice and its glossy other than that I have other glossy lip balms that do a better job  than what this is supposed to do , Really nice lip balm I like the applicator However it freezes really easily and makes it hard to dispense if its even a little cold If you leave it in your car it will freeze , I AM INLOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT This product is so refreshing and I use it everyday at school I love this flavor and it smells so good I would definitely recommend if you have chapped lips like me , Normally I just get me a quick lip gloss from a beauty store and just work with it But I was recommended this by a friend and it stayed on my lips I care for a lip gloss that will stay on my lips For the price its worth it , It made my lips so sticky to the point where I didnt want to use it I rather the lip mask and I really love laneige , Ive been using this products for almost 2 weeks now it smells really good but I was really disappointed It is sooo sticky and doesnt even last long Definitely wont be repurchasing Buy the sleep mask instead , It is too pricy for what you get It tastes good and it looks like gloss on my lips but it dries them out so quickly I bought this because I love their lip sleeping masks but this is just not the same , It doesnt last that long  Its smells good though , Ive always used to the lip mask but wanted something to use on the go I absolutely love this gloss It smells just as amazing as the mask and in my opinion honestly works better for all day where , Not crueltyfree They test on animals Hope this gets posted , I love this lip balm for regular daily use I like the convenience of the applicator  slanted so you can apply directly to your lips no need to get it all over your fingers However its not as hydrating as I expected similar to Aquaphor or Vaseline , I just purchased this today and its pretty decent honestly nothing  holy grail  though just go buy a lippie from the drugstore  gonna return today , Girl this should be a staple in your everyday life Its an amazing balmgloss very pretty and extremely long lasting Just buy it its so worth it , Im one of those people who are against animal cruelty but Ive heard so many good things about it and I absolutely love it its feels so good on the lips nice and glossy with a bit of a tint , i love to use this as a lip gloss and it keeps my lips hydrated all day the only thing is it doesnt last long , Obsessed super luxurious feeling on lips Lasts a good while before I have to reapply The smell is the perfect and it doesnt bug me at all The tube is East to use and is super shiny on the lips My lips feel so hydrated , wish I got this sooner smells amazing and lasts a long time on the lips , i would rate this 25 stars it has definitely not been the absolute WORST lip balm ive used but it could be so much better i love the lip mask and wanted to try the lip balm version but it simply does not compare the balm is to sticky and does not blend easily into the lips definitely would not recommend if you enjoy the smoother feel to lip balm , I love this lip gloss I have been using this lip gloss for the past few years and it is what has "

use it both day and night It has made my skin texture change so much and smoothen it I only get oily around my nose but I am fine because I will just wash up after the AM or PM and I will be fine Def worth it Gives you the glass skin as well , I had a bunch of surgeries last year which caused my skin to flare up all over which means it was very itchy flaky and red I bought tons of different hydrating moisturizers and toners but nothing calmed my skin down and hydrated it like this Laneige one did I use it in the AM  PM before my moisturizer It took one use for my skin to stop feeling itchy for hours before I had to reapply and about a week for me to see major results in all my issues Now my skin is hydrated and has no issues Im very thankful for this product and its now a staple in my routine , I have the driest skin known to humankind Ive found that I really notice the absence of the product in my skincare routine when I run out which is slightly annoying given the price

only focused on hydrating my skin and this product has helped my skin so much it is very hydrating and overall a really great product , It took me a while to adjust to the oily feeling this leaves on

CHANGER Immediately after I put a few drops and dapped it into my skin in the morning I was plumped and radiant I even use this to sandwich my tretinoin for the last week I use tretinoin every other day and I havent had any irritation nor dryness My skin looks so much healthier I just layer the biossance squalene moisturizer on top during nighttime and it has done absolutely wonders to my skin , Decided to give this a shot after loving the older Laneige Essential Power Toner seriously  twice daily for four years This isnt similar at all and made my dry skin sting I tested it on my arm after using it twice on my face and same sensation  wish I had tried my arm in store first and skipped it completely , Four Stars only because I found out Laneige uses animal testing after purchasing  So sad about this because it is genuinely amazing for cleansing the skin and not leaving any irruption I have VERY sensitive skin and this was great for me Sad I have to find a new toner , I dont usually write reviews but Laneige completely changed my skin i have their older waterbank version which is basically the same than this one and my skin has cleared completely Heres a before and after dont mind my face in the 2nd one lol  , a must have beyond hydrating and makes my skin look and feel amazing every time , Jaime bien lutiliser lorsque ma peau est plus sche que lhabitude Il mhydrate instantanment , After I wash my face I layer this toner on before applying my retinol  It keeps my face from drying out and it leaves a nice glowy texture  Its slightly sticky when layered so I prefer to use it at night versus the day , i wanted to love this product so bad although it moisturized my skin and reduced my dryness it made my acneprone skin break out so bad it took an entire month to get rid of the breakout , If I could only use one product it would be this Its so nice and light but so soothing and moisturizing It prevents so much irritation from retinol too I use it right after I

and luminous skin Perfect for my dry skin If you want a simple skincare routine this is for you I found that this moisturizer makes up for serums so if youre feeling lazy and dont want to do your 12 step routine you could just slap this on and call it a night , I have sensitive dry skin and this toner isnt hypoallergenic  I got tiny hives all over my face and lip swelling  Im so sad because it instantly moisturized my face then I got so red and bumps appeared out of nowhere within seconds , I have tried several other milky toners to replace this guy but none have been this good Many of them break me out or make my skin feel ridiculously tight I have very dry skin and live in high desert climate Being in a dry climate I cannot use hyaluronic acid since it dries my skin out and makes me break out If you are avoiding hyaluronic acid I fully recommend giving this a try It does unfortunately have a bit of fragrance but unusually my skin hasnt reacted negatively to it , Love this product a little pricey but its a nice hydrating toner definitely more affordable options out there but this is a nice product overall , This product is so good the packaging feels heavy and luxurious The product itself is very liquidity and I just use my hands to apply it so I dont waste any product Its odorless and so gentle and hydrating on the skin I have dry and sensitive skin and this is my holy grail , I really enjoy using this as my nighttime toner on  nights Im using actives or on nights after my allergies have been riled up all day leaving my poor face sensitive from all the sneezing  nose blowing Prior to ordering this I had been Kiehls Ultra Face Toner for quite a while no complaints I still love it I just wanted to see what else was out there and compare Its consistency is similarit is a tad thinner than Kiehls Its not tacky its soothing and it moisturizes Just what I wanted Idk if Ill reorder when Im out because Kiehls ingredients which included apricot and olive oil speak to me I like to put as much moisture into my skin as I can PRIOR to moisturizer FYI neither product leaves skin oily If more moisture or olive oil isnt your thing and you prefer a more watery product then this would be the move I will continue to use it but going forward I think Ill move this into my springsummer skincare regimen product lineup , Ive been using Tretinoin for a few weeks now and apply this before hand and let it dry in and its the only thing keeping my skin alive and well Its so gentle on sensitive compromised skin and Ill never go without it again Also great for a lazy moisturizer after a gym shower , ive noticed a dramatic change in my skins evenness tone and moisture forsure becoming a staple in my skin care forever the product is long lasting so ur 100 getting your moneys worth , I absolutely love this tonermoisturizer It makes my skin super soft and hydrated especially because i have super dry skin I would so recommend this , As someone with dry skin I know the struggle of trying to find the right products that provide longlasting hydration without feeling heavy or greasy Thats why I was excited to try the LANEIGE Cream Skin Toner  Moisturizer and I am happy to say that it has exceeded my expectations in many waysThe creamy formula glides on smoothly and feels incredibly hydrating on my skin Not only does it serve as a toner and moisturizer but it also helps soothe and balance my skin Ive noticed a significant improvement in the overall appearance of my skin since I started using this productThis product is perfect for those with dry or dehydrated skin as it provides intense hydration leaving my skin feeling soft supple and radiant I love that it saves me time in my skincare routineHowever there is one drawback I must mention I really wish LANEIGE didnt discontinue the small size of this product It can be quite cumbersome to carry around and the large size doesnt fit well in my toiletry bag for travel , One of the best hydrating toners out there I havent been able to replace it or find anything better After the shower and cleaning my face this quenches of the thirst my skin , Absolutely in love with toner Its both hydrating and moisturizing Feels so good on skin , I was intrigued by this product when I saw it in the store and purchased it to try it out It is now one of my holy grails and I will repurchase it forever It is hydrating yet gets the extra gunk out of my face Ive never used a milky toner before but I can confidently say I love them Its great for my combination skin and I dont breakout from it I wouldnt use this during the summer but it is a staple in my routine for the wintertime , Totally amazing product Super moisturizing and made my skin so soft and hydrated i received a sample of it and it definitely exceeded my my expectations , love this toner super hydrating with out using ha helps me get that inner glow , I have never written a review but this deserves my first My holy grail got too expensive for me and I was looking elsewhere Tried 12 other products and they broke me out bad after a month normal skin leaning towards oily somewhat sensitive little bumps patchy my skin progress hit a steep decline I saw this and the milkiness threw me off but the reviews were good and decided to give it a shot When I tell you this got my skin all the way right IN ONE DAY Incredible product My skin is plump smooth vibrant no little bumps nothing It took one day Im not even kidding I have been using this for about a week twice a day I dont know which ordinary products i cancant use with this but i am slowly working them in Happy to have found my new holy grail , Ive been using this for years  cannot go a day without it I have combo oily skin and although it instantly adds back hydration to my face it doesnt make me greasy It makes my skin feel hydrated and healthy I originally read this was for those with drier skin types but it works great for me as well After washing my face Ill pat this on as a firststep toner before applying any other serums or moisturizers I cannot recommend this enough to everyone with all skin types , This is an amazing product It leaves my skin moisturized soft and really gives you that beautiful creamy look immediately I use it ampm and it is especially great for dealing with tret dryness and peeling but its honestly such a versatile product that can fit into any routine perfectly while delivering worthwhile results , SO HYDRATING this is one of my top three products maybe of all time my skin has never felt better , After using this product for the past few weeks it has worked wonders for my dry sensitive skin , A staple in my skincare routine Ive purchased this now twice and have no regrets Works well for my combination skin as the first step after washing my face Im especially grateful for the light formula during the summer months when I dont want to layer lots of products A little goes a long way so I can justify the price point 12 times a year , Ive bought this product at least 4 times now and love it I recently had a skin texture change due to aging and my skin became super dry This is one of the products that brought my skin back to life , During the winter this definitely helped my skin stay hydrated at first I thought it was going to be oily but it really wasnt it just soaked into my skin quickly and left it dewy , Since I have been using this my skin is softer and more hydrated I use this night and day and I highly recommend it , This product has become a musthave for me Ive tried various hydrating toners to try to find a cheaper alternative with similar results but unfortunately nothing even comes close to this product I say unfortunately due to the price point and how many fluid ounces you get I wish there was a larger version I tend to go through this product pretty quickly since I use it AM  PM I repurchase it monthly It leaves my skin so hydrated and radiant and it truly makes a difference I use tretinoin at night as I am prone to deep cystic acne so I need a hydrating toner that wont break me out This is really the perfect product for just that , Extremely moisturizing Skins feels amazing after using this Highly recommend , I added this into my routine when my skin barrier was damaged from too many actives I have cystic acne and texture and the actives made it worse so I dialed back on products and have stuck to this with retinol PM and a barrier serum and moisturizer and my skin is the happiest its been in months  My acne is clearing up and my texture is gone  I am so happy I will never stop using this , Milky but light texture really moisturizingKorean skincare does not dissapoint2 product in 1 so really good , Ive been using this for only a week now and it has helped moisturize my skin so much This is one of the only products that Ive used with no poreclogging ingredients and has helped reduce texture on my skin I would 100 recommend if you have sensitive or acneprone skin thats on the drier side This bottle should also last a long time since you only need a couple drops and it comes with a lot of product too , I have dehydrated sensitive skin and have struggled with eczema my whole life I have never woken up to such hydrated glowy skin with no irritation It quickly became my new holy grail , Perfect for dry skin I am on tretinoin and occasionally experience retinol burns or dry spots This made my skin so hydrated in the matter of just 3 uses , My friend recommended this product to me It has really helped with the dry patches on my face during the winter I still apply a heavier moisturizer on top Also great for tretinoin users , I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I love it My skin is dry during the winter and this has been healing it Will be buying again , i really love using this i use it day and night after cleansing it makes my skin feel super hydrated and is soothing unfortunately for my wallet i will definitely rebuy  , This is a holy grail for me bc it is very moisturizing while being completely nonirritating My skin isnt the most sensitive but it is quite dry and I love that this formula has no added fragrance please never change that This is the first product I apply on my face after cleansing I just put some drops on my hands and pat it onto my face Leaving your face damp will help a lot with application Sometimes I add another layer for more moisture If your skin is dry like mine youll definitely still need to follow up with a proper moisturizer but this toner helps SO much with adding hydration to your skin AND its not irritating at all I try to use drugstore products when I can but I have yet to find a toner so moisturizing while still being nonirritating and thats why I keep repurchasing A little goes a long way I use this almost every day once a day and a bottle will last me 45 months I typically buy two bottles a year directly from the Laneige website because they have a good points system even if you only buy once a year like me This toner far outperforms their other products water sleeping mask lip mask regular moisturizer Cant recommend enough , Excellent saved my dry skin Skin feels smooth I feel beautiful I am glowing , One of the most interesting products that exists I love this stuff for an extra boost of hydration I think it is a holy grail that should staple everyones routine , such a gentle tonner that leaves my skin so dewy and refreshed , This is an excellent toner which is in fact is more like a light watered down lotion  After I wash my face I apply it and pat it in  Once it soaks in I either apply my moisturizer or a bedtime masque  Side note Ive put it into a small spray bottle and it works even better no waste of product on a cotton square , I have acne rosacea and I have tried every moisturizer from Sephora  Ulta  target of all prices and this one is the ONLY ONE that doesnt irritate my skin Please never change this , This is so moisturizing for dry dehydrated sensitive skin It really makes a difference especially during winter time and has become my holy grail , Saw this tiktok of people talking about milky toners and really wanted to try one I purchased this and it is so worth the hype Literally has left me with glass skin and has been so good to me during this dry and harsh weather Ive seen so much improvement in scarring because of acne and its reduced my redness so much If ur thinking on splurging on a toner get ur hands on this one , Truly the best toner I have rosacea and find a lot of toners to be too harsh and this one is perfect I use twice a day after washing my face and this has helped even my texture and my skin feels so nourished its truly incredible , Been using this toner  Moisturizer for the last couple weeks Happy with the results  moisturized and radiant skin , Love this stuff for a quick skin refresh after a workout or a quick moisture pick up after cleansing , So so so good I use this AM and PM after cleansing which brings life back into my skin I am combination and it doesnt cause congestion for me in my oily areas Pour directly into your hand and pat into face to get the most out of this product , This has been a repurchase many times it is undeniable hydrating with minimal ingredients and will never sting strip or do anything of the sort but there are a lot of other things these days that can do pretty much the same thing thats why this is something Id recommend on sale , Love how hydrating this product leaves me i like to use multiple layers of it drying in between and it leaves my skin feel plump I have combination skin and ive used this on my boyfriend who has oily skin and he liked the way it felt as well didnt break me out or anything as well , Ive been using this product for 2 months and at first I broke out a bit but now its a must have in my skincare routine I love how hydrating it is and how it doesnt leave my skin feeling oily , This initially made my skin burn on my recovery skin cycling days when Id use it for extra hydration I ended up cutting out my azaleic acid and chemical sunscreen and found one of those to be the culprit and now it goes on just fine I have combo skin and Im not sure its revolutionizing my skin but its an ice extra layer on recovery days , Perfect light weight moisturizer for summer months or extra layer in the dry months , This product is super hydrating but something within it caused my skin to break out  leaving me with uneven texture and whiteheads all over Once I stopped using it my skin returned to normal and I returned this to Sephora , This is very gentle Not irritating and good for either summer or winter It leaves my skin feeling wonderfully plump and moisturized Its not a miracle worker by any means but it is a solid product and I use it regularly Its not going to magically clear your acne but it does make my dry patches far more comfortable and shorter in duration paired with my FAB Ultra Repair Cream One star off because it kind of smells like rice watermilky rice to me Idk Its not a strong smell and goes away once applied but its there and its odd , Broke my skin out really bad I usually love products from this brand so I was very disappointed  , Gives my skin a glassy look The product moisturizes my skin just enough that it doesnt look oily , Didnt make much of a difference on my pots It was good as a moisturizer , I dont know what type of magic they put in this product but wow I heard good things about it so I decided to try and Im loving the results its literally milky water but once you put it on omg the beautiful moisturized glow is  I put 2 to 3 drops on my palms and I pat it all over my face Skin feels hydrated and glowy definitely recommend for dehydrated skin , i like it my skin has been really dry lately i was using other toners but not that great with any other toner id follow up with moisturizer and then sunscreen but with this i feel like i can skip moisturizer i would buy it again  , I didnt like this product at all at first I thought it literally didnt do anything But one night I decided to NOT use a cotton pad and BOOM It goes on completely different with nothing My skin loves , the best and most effective product ive used for my stubborn acne and acne scars after only about a few months use my skin is always smooth with visibly smaller barely noticeable scars , My extremely dry skin LOVES this toner I can feel the moisture immediately I have found that it works best if you apply with your hands vs a cotton swab , I have comboacne prone skin and this toner is so nourishing and hydrating A little goes a long way and it lasts a long time Gives my skin the deep hydration it needs especially in the cold dry months or when Im in a dry climate I cant be without it , when i bought this toner i wasnt expecting to love it this much my dry skin loves this it leaves my skin so beautifully hydrated and glowing , I loved this at first but tossed it in a bin half way through Keeps my skin hydrated but it makes me break out baaaaad  , really really in love w this ive been using this one for three years now and it really helps with keeping my skin hydrated especially i live in canada and winter can be really harsh with my dry skin D , Gives me the juiciest and most glowy skin ever Its a must in your skincare routine , Loving the results  Using this toner alongside inkeylist poly glutamic acid serum makes skin glow hydrated and plump , Doesnt do anything for my skin on top of wiser customer service , I have been using this product over the past couple of months and its been working great I love using it whenever I need an extra moisturizing boost and this works amazing with a hydrating oil as well if you have dry skin I love using this after a chemical peel as well , This is my second time repurchasing this toner and good god its just wonderful This is perfect for winter and dry climates and hydrated my skin so much I use this as a toner and still apply moisturizer after and it doesnt clog my pores or anything Love this one , Not for me It made my skin sensitive gave me acnes and just worsened it My skin got much better after I stopped using it , Just like the LANEIGE Cream Skin Mist its smooth but it didnt absorb not even after a few hours Its better to use it on the body it did absorb on body but not on the face Its extremely sticky and greasy during the summer time This product probably works better in colddry places , LOVE I use 5 of the 7 nights that I do my skincare at night and this is my holy grail I love it Feels so good on my skin , I got this in a whim when I moved to Florida and noticed my extremely oily skin yo suddenly so dry and breaking out  Within days of using this my skin was finally hydrated and its been about 3 months now and this might be the best my skin has ever been  Its so supple but not greasy at all  My favorite base right now is a cc matte and works wonderfully with this moisturizer  I have never used a moisturizer twice and have tried every high end product and I cant believe how well and inexpensive this product is , This tonermoisturizer is a holy grail I use every morning and noticed a significant improvement with dryness through out the day At night I use this throughout my routine and my skin just loves it , super light weight and reacts well with my skin skin feels hydrated and plump , I have never been a huge fan of toners but I saw this all over tiktok and decided to give it a try I love this especially for the winter time because my skin gets super dry I will forever repurchase , I am so so glad I came across this spray I have dehydrated skin and was searching for a toner or water spray to work with my elf Holy Hydration moisturizer I needed something that didnt have hyaluronic acid in it since the moisturizer already does  I needed a waterbased product for the moisturizer to grab onto This product is a godsend So hydrating  works perfectly with my moisturizer I cannot recommend this product enough for my fellow dehydrated skin folks or anyone using a hyaluronic acid based moisturizer or serum Quick tip this size is a better deal than the spray version so my rec is to buy this one  put it in your own spray bottle if thats your jam , my favorite toner ever moisturizing effect is nice especially in the winter , So I got this by chance because my usual Laneige moisturizer was out of stock so I thought Id give it a try Hey combining two steps to be able to go to sleep faster Sign me up I wasnt expecting much because my skin is really fussy BUT Holy moly This product paired with a serum has been a game changer I have sensitive combination skin and my skin loves this formula , oh my gosh this is amazing  I got this after hearing really good things about it and my skin was really stripped since I used way too much tretinoin like a dummy so I thought this would help and it did  almost everything burned when I put it on my skin and this was one of the very few products that didnt burn it fixed my stripped skin within a couple of days highly recommend    , A wonderful product for oily skin Smells soothing Highly recommend , i really cannot say how much i love this tonermoisturizer i have very deserty drysensitive skin and this product as helped me so much i typically use this as the first step in my routine after washing my face followed by essence serums any treatments  moisturizer but even on its own with just moisturizer is fine which is so shocking to me this is one of those products that is DEFINITELY worth every single penny i will be an avid repurchaser of this for a long thing to come , this product broke me out and wasnt moisturizing enough for my dry skin even with an additional moisturizer , I saw this product on tik tok and decided to give it a try I really really like it I am excited that this is a toner  a moisturizer all in one , Love the toner just wish it was in a spritz container , I have used this for 3 days and my skin is already glowing If you want a dewy glass complexion this is the product for

nice sleeping mask Not one I would buy but pretty nice and moisturizing for dry skin , I purchased this product elsewhere but after using it for 1 night it has made such a huge difference to my dry skin I had to write a review here Its a new holy grail product for me my skin is bouncier more hydrated less bumps just perfect definitely needed for the cooler months it says use a couple times a week but I have been using it nightly ever since I got it and its only given positive results I will repurchase again and again , I have dry skin and this product helps keeping my skin hydrated during

a drastic difference in my overall complexion particularly related to plumpness and stubborn dryness that I get in the winter combo skin I think this product is ideal for combodry skin and even oily can use it in the winter by using the appropriate amount you could probably get by with buying a smaller size than the standard Evidently the formula of this product is very rich though not overtly greasy and there is no fragrance interestingly I find this product to be similar to DBSs moisturizer so maybe give this a go if you want to save 300 lol The product also comes with a spatula which I always use for rich productsmasks which are most susceptible to pot contamination Overall this is one of my favorite finds from 2022 and I highly highly recommend it , I was gifted this sleeping mask

days my moisture barrier has visibly healed and it feels so soft on the skin highly recommend if youre struggling with fry skin , Incredibly hydrating and moisturizing and great as an overnight mask for dry winter nights It feels rich but melts into almost a gel consistently and spreads smoothly over the skin I use this daily as my last step in my pm skincare routine to seal everything in and in the morning I wake up with plump and happy skin Im only taking one star off because it does make my eyes water a bit I think because of the tea tree oil and I wish the cica was higher up in the ingredient list , I have been using this sleeping mask for over a year I apply it over the Biossance Squalane  Lactic Acid Resurfacing Night Serum and it works so well I hope they dont stop making it I only use this once a week to once a month with the lactic acid It is very rich Fantastic product , This stuff doesnt work for me which is really sad because I love the other sleeping masks and I wanted the cica to work for my redness , used a sample packet I was given a while ago I used the last two nights because there was enough product in the sample to last me more than 1x use I am so pleasantly surprised by how moisturizing this is I have been using Clinique surge moisturizer for years but I noticed it does nothing for me in the Pennsylvania winters since I moved here a few years ago but this moisturizer is amazing I have noticed how soft and hydrated my skin has been all day today wearing it again tonight and buying this tomorrow from Sephora , This is one of the only products I have ever bought and used over and over again I use this as my nightly moisturizer and nothing else gives me skin the softest feel and glowiest appearance like this It also helps with any redness I may have on my face This moisturizer is my ride or die , I use this as a mask the day after I chemically exfoliant and the centella in this heals me right up Super moisturizing and helps with redness too I think I love this one over the Water Sleeping Mask , I have the most sensitive skin Everything I use makes my face either burn or itch THANK GOODNESS for this stuff It works wonders for my skin and leaves it feeling nourished and refreshed , Please please please never change this formula This product has been game changing at calming my eczemaperioral dermatitis , I loved this product when I tried it on my lips overnight However when I applied it to my face I started breaking out badly and my forehead was severely dried out and still is a week later I Im usually not sensitive to skincareovernight masks Too bad I really wanted to love this product , Ive been using this for about a week now and I love it I use it as a daily moisturizer morning and night Everyday I wake up my skin looks great because of this , Ive been having to travel a lot recently and picked up a mini version of this as Ive heard lots of praise of this brand coming from both locally and people who live in Korea I like that this is not a super thick and greasy formula  it honestly is a lovely regular cream consistency  if it wasnt called a mask I would assume this is just a thinner consistency night cream I would happily wear this during the day throughout the year as well as I have dry and sensitive skin I love that this shows no signs of being greasy or making the skin feel suffocated like slugging with petroleum based products does but does the job of being the barrier to everything attacking the skinEach time I use this on top of my regular skincare routine I do not need to use much at all to cover the face and neck as it spreads very well and I can visibly see my irritated flushed and disturbed skin go from bright pink to my normal skin color in mere minutes I also feel the heat from my face reduce to a normal temperature shortly after applying it as well So this is the perfect skin rescue as I was able to keep my skin from staying upset after the night with this on I was able to wake up everyday to being able to prepare my skin for the battle of the day without any sign or feeling of my skin being angry at me despite the stress of travel not eating well wearing makeup all day and having to wakeup super early which always leaves my skin an inflamed mess by the end of the dayI also love using the FAB Arnica rescue pack and the only sensorial difference is in the application experience as FAB is much more acutely cooling immediately upon application and spreads on a bit thicker I love both equally I just choose which feeling I want on my skin that night I will be using this regularly and keep it in my bag for skin emergencies from now on The hype for this brand may be about their lip masks but they clearly know what they are doing for skin overall  highly impressed , Thick mask perfect for during the winter Leaves my skin dewy and moisturizing , This maskmoisturizer 100 contributed to repairing my moisture barrier The difference is instant upon application your skin feels so hydrated and soothed its forever my goto for the Winter months Dont sleep on it  , Ive had this mask for a few months now but Ive only recently discovered its real use During spring summer I would only use this once or twice a week But the recent weather change had my skin irritated red dry itchy and flaky I started using this everyday and my skin especially around my neck started calming down Im so glad having this on hand when my skin needed it , I live in a frozen tundra despite the username and my skin gets absolutely wrecked in the elements The wind snow and frigid temperatures give me awful red dry patchy skin The Cica Sleeping Mask helps repair the skin barrier and its so lovely to wake up with soft hydrated and eventoned skin again This will be a winter staple in my skincare kit , To be honest Ive not been a fan of other Laneige products because I dont find them to be hydrating enough But this cica maskcream is incredible I have combination skin and am very sensitive to fragrances My tzone is oily and my cheeks are dry so I need an overnight moisturizer that really hydrates without being greasy I wake up in the morning and my skin still feels silky smooth And a little goes a long way Ive had this for 5 weeks and I apply to my face neck and chest but it doesnt even look like Ive made a dent in the jar This product really checks off all the boxes Thanks Laneige please never stop making this , My skin PEALS in the winterI Its super embarrassing and no matter what moisturizer I wear or how gentle my cleanser is nothing works UNTIL THIS I wear this as a sleeping mask often HOWEVER I use it as my daily moisturizer almost everyday in the winter because its the only thing that works It is so amazing This is my 4th time repurchasing and I will never stop ive never repurchased anything so often at Sephora TRY IT IT LASTS A LONG TIME AND VERY AFFORDABLE , literally the best product I have ever bought this does more for me than the la rocheposay b5 balm or the cosrx propolis ampoule in terms of healing  it calms breakouts overnight so well I started using this when I started the differin adapalene and I had barely any irritation as a result its pretty lightweight and a little goes a long way and I wake up with such smoothsoft skin a lot of cica products arent as effective this one  this one does exactly what it says it will definitely will not be dropping money on other sleeping masks etc when I can just get this absolutely recommend for acneproneoily skin , Been using this product two times a week for the last three weeks I would say It is suggested as 12 times a week but I decided to just go with two Honestly when you put it on the hydration is spot on and the next day you definitely see a difference your face feels more hydrated and moisturized but I dont think its worth too crazy of a hype to give it 5 stars in my opinion , this literally makes my skin so soft in the morning i like this one more than the laneige water sleeping masks but i use them both multiple times during the week and i have skin that feels like a babys butt u must buy , Received this as part of a sampler kit and have enjoyed it It is very lightly scented I enjoyed the slightly sweet grassy scent  It is very moisturizing but not greasy or heavy feeling I have oily skin  I would buy this again , I dont know how to live without this mask Its one of the only products that I will rebuy I absolutely love the herbal cica scent its very a nostalgic feeling for me A little goes a long way thank goodness because I use it as a nightly moisturizer and a sleeping mask for days Im feeling more irritated or dry Then my skin glows the next morning It really helps soothe any redness or irritation I have , Ive purchased three containers of this now This is such a wonderful moisturizer that truly can be used during the day or at night Its so soothing and calming for red proned skin or even post at home peek Highly recommend , I use a number of the Laniege products and love them but this one is not their best Works ok but no wow factor at all Would recommend looking at other brands for moisturizing products Lanieges strength aside from its lip mask is in its cleanser , Like the product quite a bit Purchased specifically from sephora because I was wary of buying off Amazon or some other website At first the jar seemed full but after a couple of uses I popped through the surface layer of product to find a half empty jar Kind of an expensive thing for only part of what you paid for  , Literally cured my rosacea You wake up with smooth and silky beautiful skin The formula is literally magic in a bottle Great for redness Excellent hydration I wish I could give it 10 stars , OMG I love this cream  I never liked creams because they always felt too heavy on my skin  But this is the perfect consistency  I also love that it is fragrance free and feels very natural on the skin  And when I wake up my skin looks and feels so clear and hydrated and refreshed  I got my mom to start using it , This product is a game changer I had it in my cart for so long and finally bit the bullet I wish I had done it sooner Literally one use and I could feel a significant difference in my skin Its a little thick when first applying but dries down nicely and the next morning my skin feels unbelievably soft Will definitely be purchasing again  , My skin always feels hydrated and refreshed after using this over night It is a thicker cream product so a couple of times a month I usually do my normal skincare and serums but then follow with this instead of my night moisturizer , Laneige we want more products that are without parabens fragrance and are hypoallergenic Thank you , This mask is amazing I have super sensitive skin and I also suffer from hormonal acne and Ive had the hardest time finding a moisturizer that works  I use this as my every day moisturizer year round its fragrance free which is great Its super gentle on the skin It calms any redness and irritation down My skin looks so much clearer because of this My skin also feels soft and supple when I use this I 1010 recommend , This is the perfect rich and nourishing moisturizer for nighttime I am a nurse and have suffered with horrible irritation and dryness from the constant mask wearing and I look forward to slathering my skin with this when I get home from work  I know I will wake up every time with smooth  soft and calmed skin The price is honesty pretty affordable compared to similar night masks and one jar lasts me months cause a little does go such a long way This mask is a dream and I hope to never be without it  , I dont know why this product has not blown up not mad about it its been one of my staple products Ive used for over 2 years now It hydrates and clams so well I love it Wore it once while I was staying at my grandmas and she immediately bought it , If you are looking for something similar to the OLD WATERBANK FORMULA this is really close I am currently using this as a replacement and so far my skin likes it They way it sits on the skin is slightly different but definitely feels like a hydrating protective layer for sleeping , skin type mild acne tzone oily tzone sensitivethis was a PHENOMENAL purchase bought it for the cica component and its working beautifullydoesnt irritate my existing acne and if anything is helping veeery slowly to heal it my skin much prefers the hydrationbased approach to acne treatments so this product is a pleasant and most welcome new tool in my antiacne arsenalsince i have oily skin most moisturizers will just sit on top of the skin leaving an oily sheen on application and even oilier sheen in the morning no surprise this product also left a mild sheen at night BUT i woke up the next morning with beautifully hydratedplumped skineverything had absorbed as far as im concerned i dont mind looking a little bit shiny in the evenings if these are the results the jar says to use 12x a week which i started with but ive carefully worked my way up to a little bit every night and theres no irritation so i think its safe to use daily IN MODERATION , Gorgeous sleep mask I have extremely sensitive combination skin that is so frustrating as it leans towards being super dry but still with breakouts I also get eczema on my cheeks and around my nose Lately I have not had as many issues with zits and my skin has been unbearably dry I would moisturize three times a day with thick rich creams and they were not helping This mask leaves my skin so plump soft and hydrated each morning and it lasts all day in conjunction with my regular moisturizers Im obsessed It is also so so gentle on my sensitive skin , This product is absolutely amazing I bought it because I am obsessed with Laneige and any product they have is amazing My skin became really plumped and glowy when I started using this I use it like 23week and its wonderful , If youre looking for an alternative to the dr jart tiger balm because it irritated your skin this is perfect Brown girl combo skin oily t zone with sensitivity This is great I also use the sleeping mask mostly during the winter I switch to this one during the summer east coast humidity  skin change A little goes a long way , Best night mask ever Super hydrating luxuriously creamy and a delicate fragrance make it a routine staple in my skincare lineup , My favourite  the only thing that doesnt make my acne prone combination skin break out I use it every night I initially got it as a sample and am now on my third buy , This product is very hydrating while also being nice and light It is a really nice and effective mask Well worth the price Gives lots of product , loving this so far ived used it for 2 weeks it defintelh cuts down on summertime irritation and redness and i can even use it on mu shoulders which tend to get irritated and break out my skin is very sensitive so id say this is a win , This was recommended by Sephora BA as an alternative to the Water Bank blue hyaluronic cream I really wanted this to work as I have previously loved Laneige products This product is terrible It goes on thick and it takes forever to absorb into your skin It has caused my skin to break out I have returned this cream and will now stay away from their products , This works great for my dry sensitive skin It also seems to have made the redness in my face less intense , I will never not have this in my skincare rotation I use this as my nightly moisturizer A little goes a long way and Ive found it works best when a thin layer is applied That being said this product lasts me a long time considering I use it nightly I am not a huge fan of fragrance in my skincare but I enjoy the scent of this and it doesnt irritate my skin 1010 will always recommend , This stuff is amazing I usually dont see much results from face masks but this one always blows me away at how great my skin looks the next day I use it in place of moisturizer once a week or whenever my skin needs it I use tretinoin and have acne prone skin This calms my skin makes my skin glowy makes my acne less red and helps my acne start to heal overnight The sample size has lasted me several months , Incredible stuff for dry skin Cannot recommend enough , I have sensitive combination skin with rosacea on my cheeks If my skin is ever irritated red or feeling dry I will apply this as my last step in my routine and it makes a huge difference  It also feels very nice on the skin , Great moisturizer I realized that its fixed skin smooth , It definitely helps calm redness but it also made me break out  If youve got acne prone skin be careful with this one because its a pretty thick cream , Im not entirely sure if this is the exact product thats been clearing up my complexion and acne but it certainly hasnt made it worse I find this mask very moisturizing and I defiantly notice when ive used it the next morning when my redness is a bit more tamed I take off one star because this is more of just a moisturizer doesnt really feel like a mask which is totally fine but I just prefer my masks to be thicker to hold in all my products Regardless I think this product is great at doing what it claims , My skin loves this I use it every night and my sensitive skin is glowing , Excellent product I have an exra sensitive skin and this was the only product that i was able to use , I usually always have a couple spots on my face that are still a little dry This is one of the only creams that has actually helped and feels moisturising enough Even better than products that are more expensive Will keep buying for sure , I love that the product isnt scented and feels luxurious when you put it on but Ive never broken out so badly from a product I dont break out easily and this made my skin look like trash and feel greasy My skin is normalcombo , Ive tried Laneige products before and they made me break out so I decided to give this mask a second chance and I love it My skin never felt looked that good after using this product Will buy again , This past winter my face had a period where it got really dry and irritated It got super gross my skin was flaking off especially around my nose This was out of the norm since I usually have quite an oily complexion This sleeping mask worked out really well for me and through consistent use my skin calmed down and the flakes dissipated Theres a mild fragrance but to me it smells niceWith warmer weather coming up I will probably not use this every night anymore Maybe once or twice a week , Got a sample of this and couldnt get enough so had to order the full size It is so soothing especially if youre an avid picker I use this about 2 times a week and wake up with glowing skin and less redness and irritation , I use this mask whenever i use chemical exfoliants to help soothe my skin It works really well and helps calm my red inflamed skin down The cream is relatively thick and can take a while to absorb into the skin hence the reason its a sleep mask I do find that the price is high for the amount of product they give you the jar looks deceivingly large as there is not that much product inside Other than that I would highly recommend to anyone with stressedout irritated skin , Yo tea tree oil is a known allergen and is not good for sensitive skin Avoid if you have sensitivities , I wanted to love this cream but it made me break out like I was 13 again I rarely get a pimple and were talking over a dozen spots popping up in a couple days about 2 weeks after starting to use this cream , Definitely helps w redness calming feelings of drynessirritation Exactly what I wanted I love this product  No issue w breakouts , Dr jart Cica gave me little bumps so I have been hesitant to use anything Cica Well this is a winner for me I use it on retinol nights It is heavy and yes a bit greasy but in a wonderful moisturizing way I do think it has helped my barrier and improved redness Very easy to incorporate into your routine which is a huge pro Can apply this as last step at night Try it , Perfect for when your skin may flare up Very gentle and calming for sensitive skin , I quite liked this as a nighttime moisturizer and I found that it left my skin feeling soft and hydrated However it is very thick and very greasy  a little bit goes a long way In fact a little bit will spread over your entire face and a good chunk of your scalp I couldnt figure out while my hair was so uncharacteristically greasy all the time I wash it every other night until I reached for a different moisturizer one night and problem solved It was so bad that I couldnt go back to using the moisturizer on my face and I turned it into a very expensive body cream I wouldnt repurchase and I would only recommend this product to a bald person , I suffer from very red irritated and dry skin more so in the colder months and this has been a daily night time go to for me for almost 2 "
Lip Treatment Balm,"This lip balm is moisturizing smells like pina colada and lasts for a very long time but you honestly dont need this Theres cheaper options that work just the same like Vaseline lip therapy rosy lips I bought it because it was cute looking lol , I dont know why this has so many bad reviews the packaging is amazing I wish all the other laneige balms would have the same little lid to put the applicator in I love all of the laneige lip masks and balms Ive gotten So far I have berry vanilla in the mask the berry gloss and this lip treatment The smell of all of them are great but this one it reminds me of my beautiful Hawaii coconut and pineapples and it isnt over powering Im super sensitive to smells Anyway 1010 for me and I have the driest crustiest lips known to man and this helps so much , Firstly I love Laneige I can always count on the best results But this was disappointing The scent was overwhelming  the applicator was pointless Nothing about this was worth keeping , Full disclosure I have not purchased this product I did try a sample of it however and couldnt stand it I wanted to like it  it has a pretty pearlescence and I personally love the design of the pot it comes in how it has the little wand for application that lives in the lid But it smells like gasoline or gross chemically petroleum and was sooo goopy on my lips I just couldnt wear it The regular Laneige Night Lip Mask is better but even that is too overpriced and not even as good for my lips as Vaselines Lip Therapy is I use the Rosy Pink Lips one and its good for daytime cuz of the tint and for nighttime because its super moisturizing  more so than anything else Ive tried , I love the pina colada scent applicator and packaging is super cute It has a cooling sensation which I dont mind at all Makes my lips look cute and glossy will be a perfect balm for summer However if what others have said is true and they do ANIMAL TESTING I will never be purchasing again , Not worth the price I do like the applicator but everything else is meh The scent if very sweet and candy like The lip balm itself doesnt last very long and isnt very hydrating I will have to reapply a different lip balm after a few hours In fact I feel as though this makes my lips a bit more chapped They definitely dont stay smooth like when i use a different balm or even the laneige lip mask , I live in AK a very dry climate in the winter months Ive tried dozens of lip products This is my number 1 fav It isnt too thick and sticky it leaves an iridescent shine and its very moisturizing Also love that its mint , Just bought this product like last week i mainly wanted this product because of the applicator and also I heard its good for dry lips  it also has a little bit of like a tingling affect on the lips as well but so far I am really liking it , Best lip balm Ive ever used but they test on animals Wouldnt purchase but received in a kit , LOVE LOVE So much better than the original sleeping mask and is only 1 dollar more Lovely pineapple coconut scent that is so yummy hydrates my lips and lasts on my lips for a much longer time than the sleeping mask Has a buttery texture but not a greasy feeling which I feel like laneige other lip products have Also has a nice cooling feeling and plumps my lips nicely I couldnt ask for a more perfect lip product , I like it it keeps my lips really hydrated and smooth looking , Great product Have known Laneige from their Lip balms sleeping masks and SPF never new they had a lip treatment until my sister got a sample of this treatment Right away fell in love with using it You can really feel the hydration right when you put it on Smells amazing and not to strong I am usually allergic to strong smells this one if perfect smells like pinacolada It has a very light feeling on the lips and I have been even wearing it as a lip gloss It gives a perfect glossy look doesnt look like you are wearing a treatment I very much recommend for dry lips or even if you just want a hydrating gloss Definitely should buy if dry lips is a struggle or if you are struggling to find a non drying lip gloss Its worth the price , got this in the sephora perfect pout lip sampler set used once and put it down right afterwards the tastescent is very candy like like a cheap play balm and the results arent really there I can actually feel that continued use would lead to dry lips over time and I had to use a qtip to apply it was in a jar and I dont want to use my fingers to apply an anytime balm , I really dont get the hype for this brand This stuff smells very chemicaly and tastes even more so Its not special it just kindof slides around on my lips and mainly ends up in my mouth Not convenient for travel and ridiculously overpriced , I liked the sample that I received of this but when I read about their animal testing practices I was no longer interested There are so many comparable products that dont torture animals by rubbing it in their eyes and then killing them after why bother with this garbage anymore , First product to work on my dry lips almost instantly , made my lips burn and has an odd smell got it as a mini in the sephora favorites set was my least favorite item wouldve never paid , The component is my favorite love the feeling of this on my lips and the smell Laneige is just the best with lip products , Ive struggled finding a really hydrating lip product and finally found it OMG it smells sooo good and just has this luxurious feel on your lips My cracked and dry lips are now saved , The smell is TERRIBLE but the results are fantastic Would definitely repurchase again love the applicator it comes with for convenient and sanitary use Would love to see them make this without the pearlescent finish , I was looking for a higher quality lip balm because others leave them so dry but this was so  disappointing cause it does the same Definitely leaves my lips with a dry feeling No smooth feeling at all I use this and the mask and Im super disappointed Dont waste your money , I received this product in the lip sampler and this is my first Laneige product and I have to say that I love it I use it twice a day and the hydration really lasts The smell is so good and it leaves my lips looking glossy , Not hydrating at all just amplifies my dry lips Smells really good but thats about it , The results are just instant I love it I will buy it again , This is so superior to the sleeping mask that I dont even know why Laneige has both It has a comparable staying power but does so much more It is nonsticky has a universally flattering gloss finish and does not do the weird thing flaking thing many nourishing balms do I got this in a trial size but will absolutely get a full size , Multi purchase Ive been using Laneige for years and will forever purchase this The instant hydration moisture gives a plumping heathy lip look , This product is very hydrating Gives a little plumping effect and you can not even feel it Makes your lips look sexy It is worth the money , I got a sample of this in a lip sampler and wow Ended up buying the full size Love how the subtle shimmer enhances lips while still looking natural  and the slight menthol tingle Put it on before bed and my lips were still silky the next morning Also love that it comes with an applicator  that the applicator has a spot in the cap The lack of applicator storage is my only gripe with my other La Neige favorite the Sleeping Mask Love it , Ive been eyeing this product since its release and saw it in a Sephora favorites lip set so I bought that This turned out to be my favorite Very hydrating a tiny tiny bit of a tingle just enough to know its there which seems to plump a tiny bit or more like makes them filler No taste subtle tropical scent I really enjoy this and off to purchase the full size , The smell is 5 stars I got this to use while I sleep instead of the laneige lip sleeping mask This product is not as hydrating Has a tiny tingle  leaves a pretty shiny finish Id use it over a lipstick for moisture but The lip sleeping mask is better for really dry lips Also it dries sticky , Omg literally the BEST lip balm Ive ever tried Not only does it smell amazing the formula is shiny like a lip gloss but feels like the most rich chap stick EVER , Im a huge fan of the lip sleeping mask but unfortunately this one missed the mark for me because of the uncomfortable tingling sensation it gives my lips It also seems to be quite a bit less hydrating than the lip sleeping mask which is somewhat understandable but either way a let down All in all the tingly feeling is unfortunately impossible to get past and just makes me want to take it off ASAP  , Ive never loved a product line more than all of Laneiges skin and lip treatments I use this balm a lot in the brutal Midwest winters and never have dry cracked lips anymore , I really love this lip treatment I got the full jar after receiving a sample The container makes it all the better with the applicator built into the top I love using it Has a bit of a fruity taste makes your lips feel hydrated not too sticky slighttt stick as it dries It has a high shine to it Looks and feels so nice , It has a minty pia colada type sent Tingly and hydrating in the lips It is better than the OG lip sleeping mask from laneige , I love this stuff Its hydrating and really pretty The pearlescent sheen makes lips look plump I love the packaging I feel so fancy using it , I wouldnt purchase this again It moisturizes my lips after application but doesnt seem to last , Ive been using this lip product for the past few weeks and I love it I had really dry lips due to the cold weather but this helped since day 1 It helps my lips stay moisturized especially at work The lil applicator it comes with is very convenient A little goes a long way too I definitely recommend people to try this balm , This balm is actually insane I can even describe it It looks glossy but not too glossy A little product goes a long way The applicator is perfect This glossy balm isnt sticky or uncomfortable either , I only tried the sample of this product and when I tell you I tried to make that sample last This definitely is a daily balm since it is not think This moisturized my lips amazingly smells fruity and the iridescent in it creates some sort of fullness effect to my lips It is so smooth and once it dried off my lips through out the day of course my lips felt amazing on its own This is better than the lip sleeping mask It is pretty tiny a reason why I got the lip mask instead but I dont care anymore If you love something get it  , The best lip mask Not scented but wears so easily and moisturizes perfectly , I love this so much better than the lip sleeping mask I use this night and day if I dont want to use my chapstick Besides the fact that it has its own soft spatula and clickin storage in the large cap should really make use of that space with all of their products  moisturizer and other lip masksbalms it doesnt dry out my lips in the morning like the lip sleeping mask I have combo skin but it gets especially drier in the colder seasons So applying this balm at night makes my lips so much softer without feeling so tight On another note I personally like the smell it doesnt smell waxy or manufactured or disgustingly floral Thank God as I easily get headaches , I love this lip balm and the little tool I hate sticking my fingers in pots so the wand is absolutely perfect This is a nice daytime balm for me it had a very slight tingle , Super bon soins pour les lvres Je ne peux plus men passer , I like that this product comes with an applicator however I like the applicator that comes with the lip sleeping mask much more With that being said it is nice that this product has a place to store the applicator This products tingling feeling was very unpleasant I prefer the lip sleeping mask much more Especially because it is less expensive and you get much more product Unfortunately I will be returning this product but I can see how many people like it , I absolutely love this gloss it feels refreshing and smells so good The shimmer is also beautiful and not too much which I love , Hydrating and I would keep using it if I didnt absolutely hate the smell Ill stick to the other flavorsscents , I got this after getting hooked on the lip sleeping mask Of all their lip products this is probably my least favorite It doesnt go as far as their other products Its definitely a balm not a gloss But it still takes care of my lips If you want a balm this is great Personally I stick to the glowy balm or the sleeping mask , Love this balm It leaves my lips very soft and nourished My only problem is that the product doesnt stay on my lips it just kind of sinks in Great product though , it hydrates my lips and keeps them soft it smells good and the little spatula is helpful , This product immediately got me hooked on Laneige I normally try to finish out other products but I ordered this immediately after the sample finished Between lip scrub and the night lip masks my lips are in great condition , Just purchased this product because my lips are stubbornly dry I have tried so many products from drug store products to Drunk Elephant with only some success But this product WOW First off the packaging is so cute and paired with a good lip scrub its so hydrating and my lips feel so plump , Loving the Lip Treatment Balm with a subtle pearly finish  pia coladascent that deeply moisturizes while it smooths  firms lips The convenience of the applicator stored in the lid is a plus Its great during the day as an alternative to the Lip Sleeping Mask  Glowy Lip Balm bc it isnt glossy or sticky I layer this under the Lip Mask for extra hydration when needed , My lips have never felt this good ever Love it so much  will be purchasing again for sure , Love this Received it as a sample and Im definitely buying the full size It lasts me all day looks great and helps the small lines on my lips Its not super plumping but its still great , OK Im a guy I use this thing and I LOVE IT A friend of mine bought it for me once because she though I would like it and I keep rebuying it Over and over The texture is just AWESOME There is a slight tingling sensation at the beginning that you stop feeling after getting used to this I used to use Burtts Bees chapstick or Dr Brooners Chapstick and they always dried my lips I had to reapply so often it became a minor tic I think This thing does not need reapplication all the time I feel like I am putting pure coconut butter on my lips I  LOVE  IT LANEIGE I lOVE YOU I have the night one for lips too and the vanilla flavor one is BOMB A couple of things about this product for LANEIGE if youre reading this obscure post I know you are  I wish the color of the container was different Yall pink is cute but that would look AMAZING with an iridescent holographic unicorn silver or something  HummmmmK I also wish that the shine was a bit less The formula of this product is GOLD I wonder if you could make a men version of this product with maybe a mint based or even nothing for smell or flavor , Packaging is cute but would recommend the lip sleeping mask instead , Really enjoyed a sample of this that I got directly from Laneige It works so well on the lips The scent is my favorite of all Laneige lip products and the shimmer is a great lipgloss type look but with a lot of benefit to the lips I just wish it came in a squeeze tube like their lip glowy balms do , I have always purchased their other lip balm but decided to give this a try The sheen this has is absolutely beautiful but I didnt find it very moisturizing I ended up taking it back and exchanging it for the new mango flavor , Super hydratant lapplicateur est gnial trs satisfaite de mon baume , Feels and smells amazing  It does hydrated my lips  I usually leave it on at night time and it does work , I liked the sample of this so I bought the full size I like the packaging built in applicator and the shimmer in this product for daily wear but it has dried my lips out badly with continued use In my opinion the lip mask from Auric Cosmetics does way more for my lips has a beautiful color smells amazing has a beautiful applicator and built in mirror for just a few more dollars and Im disappointed that the 25 I spent on this didnt go to a new one from Auric Cosmetics lol , I absolutely love the Laneige Treatment Balm and its a constant in my daily lip arsenal At 70 years young Ive tried everything ftom highend to drugstore treatments and find this to be the very best It does everything it says it will leaving your lips very plump and full Ive been blessed with fuller lips and known for my bold lip looks I see a definite difference if I neglect to use this at night as my last beauty step youll wake up with a gorgeous pouty lip look I also wear it around the house during the day to help smooth and plump my lips a little bit goes a long way and it lasts forever Im not a lip gloss girl but I can see this being worn by someone into just wearing a gloss instead of lipstick it enhances your lips with its pearlescent shine If you wear a liquid lipstick this is is must in your arsenal no more dry peeling lips using Laneige I swear by it , This is not good Its tingly which is annoying at night It smells good but its also a little drying Dont recommend as the tingling sensation is very annoying , Ive been using it for 11 months I carry it in my bag at work and they dont believe what Ive told them does that now I cant keep it on the shelfs , If your pores clog easily then be wary of using this product It gave me white dots similar to pimples on my lips , Stick with the lip sleeping mask The spatula and product formula is 100000 better than this The applicator isnt very great to use its the wrong shape The product itself is overly fragranced and isnt very hydrating Too much product during the day will leave you with weird sparkly white lips , I have learned to not spend too much on lip balms like no more than 510 I almost never finish them Reader I got a sample of this balm and was like Instantly ready to throw my money at it The pearlescent shimmer is barely there in a good way Very wearable The scent isnt overpowering Tingling is also nice The texture isnt sticky but it is more glossy than most balms You dont need to apply generously honestly I do think the packagingwhile interesting is kinda silly No way that is sanitary in a sustainable way A tube version would be lovely I have actually never used the other Laneige balms or lip mask so I cant say how they compare All I know is that for the first time ever I feel like I will actually finish a balm , It smells so yummy and leaves your lips very hydrated , I like that its shimmeryI also like the applicator it came withThe container is cuteI do not like that it burns when it touches my lipsIt requires constant reapplicationMy lips felt less moisturized after it wore offThe tub is tiny for the price , I love the container for this and wish that the lip mask would come like this I do like this product but I would probably go for the lip mask instead of this This has glittery look to it and I dont always feel like having shimmer or glitter on my lips Nowadays I usually just add some fill into my eyebrows have blush on maybe some mascara and lip stain gloss or balm on so sometimes I feel like its a little much But I do like it for days Im wanting shimmer It does keep my lips moisturized but not as much as the mask If you havent tried it before its worth a shot to see if you like it , The Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask with Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C is probably the most lifechanging product Ive ever used so I bought this one just in case it was even better Its fine but the lip sleeping mask is so much better  its way more hydrating and nourishing If you have dry chapped lips go with that one , made my lips evens more dry feels nourishing for one minute the next I have sore and dry lips cracking , The best thing youll ever buy and its an understatement I first had it as a sample and it did wonders for my lips I live in Minnesota and the cold always had my lips extremely dried and cracked I just have to put it before bed and Im literally good for 3 4 days no need to apply it again My lips are so smooth and moisturized Even my boyfriend tried it and thinks its wonderful just get it , Love this It is my favorite lip treatment to use during the day Please make a TUBE version so I can always have it with me , I prefer the sleeping mask but the built in applicator on this one is pretty nice I think the sparkles accentuate my lip wrinkles so if that is a concern for you I recommend the sleeping mask but other than that Laneige is a great brand and I havent had a a bad experience with any of their products , smells so good and makes ur lips so soft for a long time the shimmer makes it look like a lip gloss without being sticky i  this lip mask , I love the LANEIGE lip sleeping mask but I was disappointed in this product For me the smell and taste was terrible I wasnt trying to lick it off my lips but the bad flavour was super noticeable , I got this as a sample with an order so it was like a little blister packet I really loved the product but hate sticking my fingers in a lip balmmask bc it gets in my nails I decided to just check out how much it was to see if I would change my mind Upon pulling up the product I found out the little jar comes with a silicone applicator that is PART of the packaging The packaging is pretty AND practical The product looks gorgeous on the lips and really does hydrate and heal My mouth was cracked OPEN from dry New Jersey weather and this balm helped heal them in like two days All while looking stunning for day and not being sticky for bedtime Could not recommend this more highly , I have to admit that I was a little unsure when I received  the sample But this product is phenomenal It made my lips soft hydrated and they had a gorgeous glow , I love love love this product The balm leaves my lips so soft and I love the cooling sensation you get after applying Im a big fan of the packaging as well This product will remain a part of my skincare routine , Love this treatment Although it seems this is aimed to be the daytime version of the overnight lip mask I still love it for nighttime I love the slight minty sensation and smell I love love love the packaging Nourishes my lips so good and makes them look juicy af which makes me use it during the day as well  , Best one I have try my lips are very dry and I have try so many lip treatment and this one by far the best Highly recommended , I received this one as a sample first I liked it Then I bought the full price productPerfect for my lips It gives super hydration , Recib una muestra y me encanto Mis labios se mantienen hidratados y sin lneas , hook line and sinker I purchased a full size because I loved it so much My lips are extremely moisturized and I dont find myself reaching for chapstick or balms multiple times a day I put it on once in the morning sometimes once at night and I am good to go Its very soothing I like the slight iridescence it gives as well To me it has a slight watermelon taste Im not sure where Im getting that from as its described as being mint The packaging is really cute The price is worth it , Was hoping to love this as much as I do the lip mask but it missed the mark I feel like I have to apply this constantly or my lips end up dryer then they were to begin with , i consider myself a chapsticklip balm connoisseurwith about 25 years of experience  i love this stuff it moisturizes so well with no need to apply often doesnt leave my lips feeling dry afterwards and has a nice cooling gentle plumping effect , Save your money Go with their glowy balm or lip masks Highly fragrances so if youre sensitive I wouldnt recommend Doesnt nourish hydrate or protect so its basically useless The spatula is appreciated but because of its formula you dont really need it or a lot of it It disappears after 1530 minutes and if you rub your lips nervously lol like I do its gone within minutes This is totally preference but the opalescence to me is completely unnecessary for a product like this and kind of unflattering if you accidentally apply too much Save your money munchkins Their glowy balm is just fine  , I received this product as a sample and it was great I purchased the full sized product Its long lasting and moisturizing I can wear it on my nomake up makeup days and it makes my lips look juicy Its good for overnight as well , Love at first swipe The shimmer and the gloss it leaves is FLAWLESS Hardly see any lip lines AND it lasts sooo long Even when it wears off my lips are still very moisturized This is marketed as a plumping lip balm but doesnt do much in that aspect except tingle a little Get it Now , I use it at night and its the only thing thats fixed my lips and it lasts all night , I LOVE LOVE LOVE I wear it every night to bed A stable in my skin routine I love the glossy finish so much that sometimes i use it during the day as well with a great nude lip liner , Good product got a sample size  liked but similar products for cheaper price , AMAZING i love laneige and this came out and I had to buy it this leaves a cooling on your lips and smells great the applicator is also great because you can carry it with it , The best lip treatment for dry lips hands downIt is not at all sparkly despite having a holographic shimmer in the jar I wear it overnight to restore my lips and as someone who has a drawer full of dozens of soso lip glosses and I throw out the dozens I dont like this is the one that I keep buying It is indispensable , Received this as a sample with purchase and I absolutely loved it Made my lips feel so soft and a little bit goes a long way I will be purchasing this , I love this so much It is the most long lasting moisturizing stuff Ive ever put on my lips and it smells like pina coladas I put it on my lips before bed and when I wake up theyre still moisturized and look more plump If this was a more aesthetic brand like dior this would be constantly sold out because this stuff is top tier and worth it , Extremely glossy and smooth on the lips I apply this at night and my lips are beautiful in the morning , I really didnt like this product It has a weird almost menthol like cooling sensation that I did not enjoy It also just goes on clear From the pictures it looked like it had a slight white cast but it doesnt , Love this product I had such an issue with dry peeling lips and it has been an endless cycle this last year I would put Vaseline and regular lip balm but it just didnt help This worked so well and my lips havent looked or felt this good in a long time 1010 recommend , Got a sample and used on a day I was super chapped Woke up completely healed Will reorder this for sure Would love a tube version of this product , I got this as a sample and used every day one to three times a day for about a week I found that it dried my lips out I really loved everything about it look feel smell but not the drying and its not cruelty free It brought more color to my lips and seemed to make them look a little bit plumperfuller If it was cruelty free and not drying I would purchase it I would recommend if you dont have sensitive lips , Ive tried 6 lip treatments to try to soothe dry vertical lines over the past several months and this is the only one that worked The same brands overnight lip treatment did absolutely nothing but this one is a total rockstar Im in love with this product and will reorder religiously because its the only moisturizing lip balm that actually lasts all day or night Im blown away , The best lipgloss ever Smells good moistens and doesnt leave a film like some glosses do Its not sticky either , Smells AMAZING and feels so fresh theres a minty hint and hydrates very well Im obsessed , I got this product because I wanted to check out the built in applicator I like this just as much at the night lip balms The applicator is pretty cute It smells very fruity with a strong pineapple scent Overall very hydrating At the price point it is an expensive lip balm and I think people should try this out at least once and then stick to the night lip balm , Love this balm noticed a difference on my lip after thre first use It does tingle and sting on my lips though , Love everything about it The packaging is obviously the best part like you dont have to dig your fingers in the balm but also the pia colada scent is yummy I also feel like it has an invigorating minty feeling when you first apply it which feels nice Its a nice shiny finish and easily spreads on the lips I took off a star because this product vanishes super quick from the lips I dont expect the product to stay 100 if Im eating or drinking something but this just disappears really quick with just a sip of water , LOVE the packaging and applicator I will say it goes on a bit more like a gloss but feels like a wonderful balm Definitely great for a moisture boost in the lips and looks shimmery and beautiful , Just the right amount of nourishment Not too sticky I love it for my chapped lips Noticed a difference after first application , This jar is so clever with the applicator that stores sanitarily right in the lid Goes on shimmery and moist I have sensitive lips somehow and this is very comfortable Not as moisturizing as Laneiges night mask but very good love it , I like how this looks on my lips but this feels more like a lip gloss than a lip treatment balm I have lips that benefit from treatment ingredients and got little to no benefit from it I like the sheen  the scent and will be reusing the container but other than that not a repurchase , I love this product  I love how hydrating this is  its not sticky  I use it every morning  It has an applicator built into the cap  I just bought another one because I ran out , I dont know what it "
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer,"I dont really like to use this on my face because it leaves a greasy film If you have dry skin and you apply a thin layer I suppose it can work for you , Go TO Everyday lightweight moisturizer I think this brand has some excellent formulations The packaging is a bit too much for the quantity of the moisturizer it comes with It does not leave a greasy finish yet plumps and works very well under make up , after just 4 DAYS i saw immediate changes in my skin it looks so hydrated and dewy i have drynormal skin so usually my face looks very dry and as soon as i started using this moisturizer i felt immediate changes , Amazing quality moisturizer for combination skin Lightweight with the perfect amount of hydration to the skin Love this brand and product , Started using this cream after I had a sample for my birthday in 2020 I am from Alberta so it is very dry here all year long and this cream has always provided a great hydration on my combinationacne prone skin I love how lightweight it feels how quickly it penetrates the skin and its fresh smell I even converted my boyfriend to buying this cream for himself , I have very sensitive skin so Im always nervous to try new products but Ive been using this for 2 months now and I love it , Used for over a month i can say my face has never felt more moisturised I love the scent and texture Overall leaves you feeling hydrated and clean Love love love it , I LOVE this moisturizer I have to admit I really like all LANEIGE products This is nice and light and perfect for prefoundation layer , The moisturizer works well but the fragrance is strong and artificial to the point where it feels odd to put near my eyes I expected it to sting it doesnt because of the smell making it seem cheap Unfragranced would be 45 stars , I was so excited when this dropped I bought the entire line I used this for weeks and eventually developed an allergic reaction to the product which then caused me to have a psoriasis flare up which I had never had before using this product in combination with the eye cream Sensitive skin beware the fragrance is way too strong , I tried this as a sample in the Lunar New Year kit and it was a shock how strong the fragrance is I prefer without fragrance dont mind a little but this is very heavy It also is a bit sticky to me vs dewy , Felt nice going on very rich and creamy but the fragrance is strong as soon as makeup touched it it began pilling instantly The pilling is unavoidable and frustrating , This truly is such a nice moisturizer Although the scent is pleasant I think its a bit strong or I would give this 5 stars It kind of smells like clean laundry , Best moisturizer for the winterI bought a Sephora faves Lunar New Year kit and this was in it I use it as a night cream and it lasts into the next day , Im so disappointed in this product I really like the old formula it was my goto This one feels like Im paying over 50 for 10 quality , Love this stuff Feels great on my skin and keeps it hydrated , Good product but not a ton of product for the price point If you dont mind splurging go for it but its nothing revolutionary , This is nothing like the old formula After using this product I started breaking out and Im not usually the type of person with lots of acne , Leaves my skin very sticky and heavy feeling pills lots when I try to apply any makeup very disappointing , Idk if its just me but every time i use this moisturizer it pills on me so bad Not a fan at all And the smell is not great either , Love Laneige products but disappointed this moisturizer is so heavily fragranced I use a lot of actives on my skin and because fragrance can be irritating I dont feel I can use this everyday , Absolutely LOVED this Its so good for combo skin I do see the difference between the old formula and this one but I still like both However I wish they kept the old packaging this one doesnt feel as nice , The best moisturizer Just need a little bit and your skin feels so different after 1 day Its light weight and doesnt irritate my sensitive skin even keeps my skin hydrated with my retinol , I love love love love this product right now it is definitely my favorite moisturizer My skin is very dry and I live in Boston where it snows and rains and its cold all the time Surprisingly this moisturizer has kept me hydrated throughout and my skin feels velvety smooth The only other moisturizer I use is Caudalie and this one really knocked it out of the park My only bad thing would be that its way tooooo small It did last me exactly one month so maybe its not bad but idk i felt like it was very little , my favorite moisturizer ever make my skin feel so hydrated its kind of on the expensive side but its a great way to treat yourself , the smell is BAD i even checked to see if it was expired it wasnt but i have yet to find another moisturizer that works better for my super sensitive skin its so lightweight and still moisturizes really well , I received this product a few years back in a gift set  it has always been my holy grail since Its very lightweight and perfect for my dry skin in the winter The packaging is super cute too , I finally had used up all of my jar of the prior formula and it was time to try this one The old water bank moisturizer was my holy grail found after many other moisturizers had bad ingredients were too oily or pilled It also had a pleasant subtle scentThe new moisturizer is so disappointing It has the same name but it shouldnt because its not the same moisturizer The texture is different its much more slick and oily compared to the previous cloud texture The prior formula was so easy to pat on and freshen up dry skin This just makes you look oily and it has a bad smell like play doh40 is expensive for moisturizer but the prior water bank moisturizer was worth it to me This is not worth using for free and I sadly now find myself on the hunt for the perfect moisturizer againPlease change the formula back I care 0 about the packaging change but they ruined a perfect moisturizer , Ive been using this product for a couple of weeks now and it is hydrating on the skin Makes my skin soft I HATE the smell and I do miss the old formula I dont know why they decided to change it , I am devasted they decided to use the fad ingredient HA The original was my favorite moisturizer of all time This dries my skin out Perfect combo of intense moisture while not being greasy Drugstore moisturizers are better and much cheaper than this new version For now I am enjoying my Innisfree moisturizer which is similar but not the same as the original waterbank , Its a wonderful texture  goes on velvety smooth and melts into the skin  but after a couple days of using it Im really broken out , Love this please make a bigger version 50 ML IS NOT ENOUGHHH LMFAO , I absolutely love this moisturizer Its so hydrating and never makes me break out and Im acne prone Laneige skincare never disappoints and my routine is quickly becoming all from the brand  , I was hopeful since I loved their previous lineBUT this made my face very dry , I received a trial size of this moisturizer and I would say its good for normal or oily skin only It is a very light moisturizer the consistency is almost like a serum I actually thought maybe I had the serum version and not the moisturizer but it says its the moisturizer cream It doesnt do anything for my dry skin I would have to layer it with another moisturizer in order to get the desired effect If you have dry skin I wouldnt waste your money on this one , So sad they changed the formula Wanted to love this one but I just couldnt The original formula was so smooth and super hydrating Absolutely devastated , I could honestly write a diatribe about how disappointed I am in the new formula but I primarily want to implore Sephora to remove the hundreds of 5star reviews because they are NOT for this product This is misrepresentation I loved the original water bank  exclusively used it for years I used to buy multiples at a time and sadly have officially run out Not only is the new Fall 2022 one a different formula entirely it smells strangely and dramatically dried out my face I HATE it I threw it away after two days I know Sephora isnt responsible for the formula but they are in charge of the community on their site and I hope this misrepresentation is remedied , Love this moisturizer Made my skin feel hydrated and smooth  , I am loving this moisturizer It has really helped rehydrate my dry winter skin and changed the game for me I love how thick it is you dont need to use very much It comes with a little applicator stick which makes applying the exactly the right amount super easy Will absolutely be buying again , The smell is unpleasant strong and will not fade I cant sleep , This cream made my face burn almost immediately after applying probably due to the fragrance If not for this I think I would have loved it Its super smooth and melts into the skin beautifully , Good moisturizer Like the consistency and feel but the smell is very strong and awful Couldnt get over the scent I would recommend if you can get past the smell , Loveeee this product its so moisturizing and nourishing It goes on so well only comment is that the container seems like a waist of plastic Its aesthetic but not environment friendly , Only gave it 4 stars due to the packaging even though its beautiful Laniege please make a refill for this as I hate wasting so much plastic every time I repurchase This is truly the best moisturizer Ive tried in a long time I actually have oily acne prone skin but got a sample of this and it made my skin so smooth and my breakouts have cleared I dont get as oily during the day and my makeup lasts way longer , this is still my go to moisturizer it does what it needs to do most of the time its lightly scented but doesnt bother my skin like most scented products do i dont find it works as well as the previous formula and if you live in a place where the air is frequently dry this will not be strong enough on its own , This is best used as a hand moisturizer the fragrance is incredibly strong It smells like cheap hotel body lotion I had a free trial and Ill say it doesnt moisturize to the degree I need and the perfume is way too strong to use on the face Im not even sensitive to fragrance Its just incredibly pungent , PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA I have super sensitive skin and this used to be my absolute favourite product Now it makes my skin break out and peel like crazy So disappointed , This is my holy grail moisturizer I have tried so many others but this one does the job A little amount goes such a long way My face stays hydrated for 10 hrs and minimizes the redness 1010 , I bought the skinfix peptide cream and it broke me out really bad I bought this after returning the skinfix moisturizer Its great for all skin types and is very hydrating , I am literally obsessed with this moisturizer It makes my skin feel so soft and supple My husband has even noticed a difference since I started using it , this is THE BEST moisturizer i ever used it made my face so smooth and hydrated that lasted all day and i got so many compliments on how glowing my skin is , Got a sample of this and I instantly loved it I typically have dry skin and it wasnt too heavy or too oily it hydrated my skin so nice Definitely recommend if you have dry skin , I have super dry skin so most creams arent moisturizing enough but this is perfect for me in the morning and it doesnt make my face super shiny either like Ive found with most creams It smells sort of like baby wipes and its not extremely overpowering so its pretty nice unless youre sensitive to fragrance I would recommend this for people with drier skin but it may be too thick for more oily skin types , I used this moisturizer for months and my skin was greattt but then i decided to experiment and try others but none of them worked for me the way this one did i have oily skin but i like to feel really moisturized and i feel like this is perfect for that its not too light but also not to think to the point where it feels greasy i think its an amazing basic moisturizer and 100 recommend for someone with acne prone skin , Not worth the cash just get a water based moisturizer from the drug store , I loooove this cream It hydrates really well and it never stings Its perfect under make up and as a day cream I feel like my make up lasts longer with this Im on my second jar , This cream sort of retains moisture better than the previous formula its ok I dont love it BUT I do need to point out after I apply it if I massage my skin just briefly it rubs off like eraser bitsand Im positive its not dead skin lolDoes this happen to anyone else , Why did the formula change Its terrible The smell sucks it doesnt spread as easily and it feels SO heavy Who did this Yall ever heard of market research SMH , Got a sample of this and quite enjoyed using it Its very slick and a little goes a long way I didnt feel the need to use much to cover my face The texture is nice and smooth and it made my skin feel very nice Removed 2 stars cause of the fragrance It is HEAVILY fragrance and smells like Im rubbing perfume on my face If it wasnt so fragranced Id give it 5 stars Didnt break my out either , I was hesitant about this product after reading reviews of a formulation change but I absolutely love it The entire line works incredibly well and is super low maintenance , I love this moisturizer I have extremely sensitive skin and most products make me break out in some type of way I have been using another moisturizer that is also great but I wanted to try something different I am a fan Its light and not oily No dry spots Even moisture I definitely recommend this product , The old formula was my holy grail moisturizer and since they reformulated I hate it I have wasted hundreds of dollars looking for a replacement brand Dont waste your money , Ive tried many moisturizers this is by far the one Ive been using the longest throughout the year Its worked very well with my skin especially during the winter , Not even comparable to the old formula Has a much stronger smell and made my face feel tight So dissapointed , While this formula feels thick  luxurious upon putting it on  is definitely a solid nighttime choice its horrible for the daytime This pills with every single SPF I have attempted to layer over it , Agree with others that the original formula is fabulous and this new formula does not compare The new formula smells almost glue like and is oddly more drying You also have to use more for your skin to feel moisturized Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin based off smell alone I also dont like the packaging of the new formula Hopefully they always have the original also available for purchase as it is amazing but harder to find now , Please for the love of god bring back the old formula This new one has such a chemical smell to it and made me BREAK OUT everywhere I loved the old one since it smelled so good and was really thick this one is disappointing , I was in love with their old moisturiser and held off getting the new one but Im obsessed with it My skin is soooo soft and still doesnt affect my acne prone skin It doesnt work as well under makeup but I use it at night now , I am beyond disappointed on this new formula It has a nasty chemical smell and cause me to break out BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA All the old reviews should be removed since its reviewed for a product thats discontinued , Its genuinely a bummer that they replaced the original formula The container shapes are pretty cute and easy to use but the inside isnt the same Not a very thicc hydrating moment if youre down for it Suitable for anyone who prefers light and fastabsorbing formula instead of heavy and slowabsorbing its definitely for you I had been loyal to those products but its not the same and not really working for my skin anymore Gotta bail those Laneige products Hope to be able to find the dupe of the original formula please lemme know if theres any dupe , Im beyond disappointed I have been using the old formula for years and it was the only thing that hydrated my dry face It felt soft and plump after use This new formula is terrible Its not as rich and very drying I have dry patches now and my make up looks flaky , This may just be the best thing Ive ever put on my face My skin has been relentlessly dry and dull my entire life I received a largeish sample of this and after two days I knew I had to invest in the full sized product My skin is silky supple and glowing Ive tried countless creams and serums over the years and never before had a result like this My only complaint Id be happier if it were unscented The scent is I N T E N S E and imho utterly unnecessary , Got this as a sample It absorbs well and packs a lot of moisture punch without being too heavy I used this sample while traveling and when my skin was feeling dry and my skin was revived , Love it Really keep my skin hydrated and refreshed , Lineages original water bank moisturizer was perfect It went on so smoothly and hydrated like no other product out there I dont know why the decided to change the formula I tried this one out in hopes that they would tweak it but its a whole new product Not worth it at all Im so disappointed , I wanted this because the consistancy is soooo nice and i love hyaluronic acid but it smells like a perfume I dont have super sensitive skin but the smell is so strong it makes me feel sick if it had none i would love it im a bit dissapointed , Bring back the old formula  For those with sensitive skin the old formula was amazing and so soothing This new junk is cheap too thin and smells brutal Not a good move Laneige , The original one was absolutely the best moisturizer ever it looked great under makeup  when I bought the new one everything just falls apart MY MAKE UP DOES NOT LOOK THE SAME  After a couple hours its starts to separate and looks awful  I , The new formula is sticky and is not hydrating My skin feels dry immediately after using it and I honestly think it hurts my skin more than helps it  The original formula was amazing and it made my dry sensitive rosacea prone skin feel amazing   I am so disappointment that the formula was changed Do not believe the marketing that this  new product is improved it is not improved and is now unusable I do not recommend anyone buys this new product , Love this cream I got a free sample and loved it and had to buy the full size Its very hydrating without feeling greasy or oily at all I love the finish and it looks great under makeup , The old scent is much  heavier and possibly more pleasant but the new one doesnt smell gross like everyone says Its a light floral smell think wishfulhoneywhipesque that dissipates quickly I like the finish of the newer formula much much better Its more glass skin and less grease ball like the old one I dont find any change in the moisturizing aspect of it I still feel very quenched all day with just a dime sized amount first thing in the morning It looked fantastic under nars soft matte foundation And by itself it didnt make me sticky which is a personal pet peeve for me and I wont use creams that stay sticky all day The poor reviews on here shock me because its not too different from the original If you love this cream i think youll continue loving the new formula Im sure And if youre buying it for the first time theres nothing out there like it and I really recommend it , This cream is thinner than the original and smells like vomit The old one had the most beautiful scent and was much more moisturizing This one pills under my makeup , Wonderful moisturizer for the summer months but it doesnt feel hydrating enough in the winter  I really recommend it for people struggling with acne pronecombooily skin , Im seriously so thankful to the Sephora employee who recommended this cause its the only moisturizer thats made my dry flakypeely skin disappear , A little goes a long way I bought this for the first time when I was actually in LAs Ktown and have been obsessed with it since I have combination skin where my tzone is oily and my cheeks are dry I just a small swipe on my cheeks and forehead and chin and can manipulate it to be all over my face and down my neck Such a nice feeling It doesnt feel oily  , This silky cream is positively luscious It feels fantastic going on and provides exceptional moisturizing for my combo skin  My only issue is the roselike fragrance is a bit too much for my liking but thankfully it disappears almost immediately after application  If you want something comparable with virtually no fragrance go for Belifs bestselling The True Cream   AquaBomb , After using this product my face broke out in tons of little itchy bumps I had to get a steroid from my doctor to treat Will return The old version seemed perfect , I did try the older version and my experience was pleasant Its one of the first products containing a silicone that hasnt caused me issues and actually has a solid contribution to my complexion Its wasnt heavy and left me nicely moisturizer for about 5 hours Changing of the seasons and tret have an influence in my skin so this may hold out all day for somebody who doesnt have the mentioned issues , I love how hydrated and soft my skin feels and looks after using this cream My favourite to take on vacation , Ive been using the water bank moisture cream for a while now and it changed my skincare routine It left my otherwise very dry to combo skin feeling amazing I was nervous about the change to this item since Sephora no longer carries the full size version anymore I read online this is even better but I disagree It doesnt feel as rich or doesnt let  my skin feel as soft or hydrated After using it for a few weeks I ordered the original version from the company website Its not awful but not as good as the original , Im happy with this even the reformation This leaves my skin smooth and moisturized , Unfortunately the cream doesnt fit with me it gave me little pimples and itchy skin Also yes its moisturizing but I dont like the feeling of the cream on my face , Ages ago I came across the original productformulation and I LOVED it It was incredible My skin was plump refreshed and felt so hydrated It never pilled and was perfect to wear under makeup It was a holy grail product Now Theyve reformulated Why Why ruin such an amazing moisturizer Please go back to the original I havent been able to find anything of the same caliber since and Im so sad , Im over 70 yo and have been discouraged by fine lines This moisturizer is by far the best ever  I love the way it makes my skin feel and a little goes a long way I have a tendency towards enlarged pores and this doesnt clog them at all After having used it for 2 12 weeks a friend whom I hadnt seen for a couple of years commented on how beautiful my complexion is  Its been a long time since Ive heard that     and remember Im 2 years older than last time we saw one another  , I have been a loyal Laneige customer for a long time I swore by the water bank moisturizer because it completely changed the texture of my skin for the better HOWEVER this new formulation is complete garbage I have combination skin but I never in my life have had dry patches on my face When I first used the new formulation I noticed a huge difference from the old formula My skin felt fine initially but within an hour I felt dry and I had FLAKES OF SKIN on my face Not to mention I started breaking out I dont have acne prone skin Ive never had an issue with acne This was a complete let down from Laniege and I wont be a retuning customer to their brandIn my opinion the closest replacement I could find a bit pricier was Tatchas water cream And its my new favorite now , It feels lovely but smells exactly like Summers Eve products  And thats just really really offputting , Love the hydration it gives my skin The best part is that it feels lightweight and doesnt lookfeel greasy on my face , Its a nice formula  soft and silky Sits easy on the face Easily absorbs However I found myself using a lot of it because my face still felt dry after initial application And you get so little for such a big price tag , Makes my skin so hydrating always a must have for me Lightweight moisturizing hydrating andwell what else would I want , The smell is terrible Definitely miss the old formula , Garbage It is not super hydrating and makes everything peel , Bring back the old formula It was fantastic  real bummer , I loved this product in the past and found it was a great moisturizer  However as others have noted since they changed the formula it is not as effective  I will also be looking for another product once I finish my current supply , I do love Laneige products They are great moisturizers However the formula must have changed when the packaging changed because it is not as moisturizing as before I will be looking for a new moisturizer once this one is finished , Im sad I really liked the highlighted ingredients so decided to give it a try The fragrance is what isnt working for me I think this would be an excellent moisturizer if they removed the fragrance or at least offered a fragrance free option for those of us with sensitive skin , I loved the original formula in the glass jar Honestly if they just took out the fragrance ingredients from the OG formula it wouldve been perfect They ruined it I get dry patches with the new formula , 0 star  Unfortunately I have loved the old version of this I still have a partial jar left but wanted to compare the two This one misses the mark and is making my face sting  I have acne prone and sensitive skin and I can tell already this is a absolute NO for me Now I need to find a new moisturizer , Never tried the old formula so I have no bias I am very lucky and have very good genetics I have had little to no blemishes ever in my life No issues with fragrance mixes either Within a month of using this I have broken out on my forehead cheeks and nose Cream is thick and feels heavy at times but I chalked it down to being hydrating Im assuming it just sits on the pores and doesnt actually penetrate the skin  Gave a month and half to give it a fair trial , I used to love the old formula I had finally found a face cream that didnt make me break out but within two weeks of using the new formula Ive started breaking out  unfortunately I will be back on the hunt for a new face cream Wanted to leave this review in case anyone is wondering how different the new version is The smell also isnt as nice as it used to be , PLEASE go back to the old formula The old bottle the old formulait was all perfection Not sure why they decided to go and switch it up Why not make an additional product offering rather than ruining something that was so high quality and luxurious This formula isnt great and clogged my pores unlike the old formula Super disappointed and retuned it Now Im back to trying to find the perfect moisture barrier moisturizer , I love this moisturizer  Leave your skin soft  I put some every day and every night and it really hydrates all day  , As someone with dry skin I seek products with extra hydration especially my moisturizers Unfortunately their usually a thicker consistency or just dont hydrate my skin like I need it to But this product right here not only leaves my skin super duper moisturized but its also the perfect consistency that isnt too heavy It absorbs perfected into my skin and is probably one of my favorite moisturizers of all time , The cream itself is good but I didnt find it goes well with my other product I wouldnt repurcharse this I like the Omega water cream by Inkey list better ans is way more cheaper , Old formula was WAY better Will not be repurchasing this new one , I used to love La Neige old formula and it really changed the game for me I received a sample for this new formula and my skin is SO DRY AND PATCHY Its wild it has changed my skin so much and I only used it for a few days Will have to go and find something else now , I LOVE this product so much This is one of my favorite creams I have sensitive skin that tends to be dry and this cream is soft creamy and gentle to my skin I used to use the previous one and I was a bit scared when they said they were rebranding but this one is great too and smells like green tea which is very relaxing , I throughly like this cream Laneige used to make me break out when I was in the early teens I figured I would try it again I have been using it for 2 weeks now as a daynight cream It leaves my skin so soft no break outs and the smell is so subtle not over powering at all The packaging is very slick as well I will definitely be purchasing again , Never tired the original formula but this cream dries down heavy thick and greasy I always get a few breakouts when I use this Its also very fragrant which isnt always the best for some more sensitive skin types its a shame because its not worth the 40 dollars at all , The old formula was amazing it made me love the brandThis new formula its just okThe packaging tho I hate it I travel often and it just takes up so much space form my toiletrie bag I preferred the old packaging , Rip the old formula That is what made me love this moisturizer Its definitely less scented but lacking in hydration in this new formulation , Really like this moisturizer A little goes a long way  its light but very moisturizing , Amazing Makes my skin feel silky smooth every morning when I wear it at night Light and silky texture too The smell is pleasant as well I will definitely be restocking Loved Laneige products already but love them more now , It made me breakout within two uses Tried a mini had to stop using I have dry skin prone to losing elasticitywrinkling now that I am in in my 30s I do not get breakouts like that usually Glad I only got it as a sample , Hydrate my skin ver"
Radian-C Cream with Vitamin C,"This is the best morning moisturizer Ive ever used It cleared some hyperpigmentation around my jaw and cheeks and a little bit goes a long way which makes the small amount worth it I have repurchased this 3 times and will purchase it again Highly recommend it , I didnt like it that much The smell is not as yummycitrusy as i would have thought The cream leaves skin still stickywet and sweatyish Not my fave at all , I felt obligated to write this just in case anyone had the same reaction I did and gets scared There is some chemical in here that I am severely allergic to and Ive never had an allergic reaction to a skincare product before including Laneige products so it is an uncommon chemical I broke out in hives the product crusted and clumped on my face and my face was severely inflamed It burned , Honestly it didnt worked for me May its something about the skintype Love the smell And texture , If you have sensitive skin avoid this It burned my face and its painful and itchy I tried it twice The first time I wasnt for sure if this is what did it Waited a month used it again and it is certainly this I have used other Laneige products with no issue but something in this does not like my skin , Great texture and I like level of moisture it gives me for day time Ive bought this product several times and keep going back to it Not to mention it smells really good Im still looking for a creamier option for nighttime , I dont know what sorcery is in this product but in 2 days Ive already seen improvement in my skin My skin is less red more even toned and healthy looking I purchased the vitamin C serum and moisturizer and am so impressed I will definitely continue to use and repurchase , Very hydrating smells great and leaves skin glowy , Great hydrating and brightening cream I use this at night sometimes with the sleeping mask over it but it has evened out my sun damage and overall skin tone I wish it came in a 50ml but regardless this is now a staple for me , DO NOT BUY I received this as a gift and tried it last night this morning I had chemical burns on my face and horrible itchiness I have more sensitive skin but no product should do this , Third time purchasing this product This is the best vitamin c cream Ive used so far , Hands down the best vitamin c radiance creamI felt my face glowing all dayoverall  happy with these  productjust pricey and exactly in three months the bootle was emptybut still would like to buy again , Can I just talk about the packaging for a second Amazing It feels like 100 bottle The moisturizer has a very subtle scent and delivers all day hydration Love love love this product , For the past month Ive been wondering why I feel this terrible sunburn feeling on my face Its burning and peeling and itchy I have finally pinned it down to this cream after removing it for a couple weeks and then trying it again I do not recommend I see in the reviews others have had this same issue Do not buy , This stuff is amazing It smells lightly of citrus and the consistency is not overwhelmingly thick or watery A small dot of this GOES A LONG WAY The packaging is misleading as the line under the word Laneige is where the product bottom actually is there is more packaging than product which is not cool I have super oily skin and live in Colorado where my skin is constantly either dry in some spots and overly oily in others This has hydrated my skin to the point that people made positive comments about the way I look after using it No breakouts or irritations since using it a week now and I only use it in the AM , Im on my 3rd or 4th container of this It has made my skin super soft and helped with the redness I use it under my day time moisturizer I used to use it day and night but my new night time moisturizer is very heavy so now I only use it in the morning , Made my skin break out I got more tiny bumps through out my face , Was so disappointed when my old HG the Water Cream moisturizer old version in blue jar with white cap was discontinued Decided to try this moisturizer and was pleasantly surprised It works very well with my reactive combo skin very oily yet very dry So many products irritate my skin and make it red and cause flaky patches Its really hard to find a moisturizer that my skin actually likes This is it It feels light weight absorbs nicely and moisturizes without making my skin feel like a grease slick Doesnt cause any redness and has improved the texture of my skin My skin feels hydrated and smooth not congested or textured This is definitely a keeper , Des la premire journe jai pu constat les bienfaits sur ma peau de cette crme Radian C  Ma peau tant sche normalement a t trs bien hydrat par cette crme Ma peau tait tellement douce hydrate et radieuse Avec le cocktails de produits entirement naturels et la vitamine C mon teint ma sembl plus clair Cette crme est exclusive chez Sephora  Cest une trs bonne crme que je me promets dacheter  , after using for about 5 days woke up with breakouts white heads and read splotches all over my face  skin has finally been clear for over 2 months and havent changed anything else in my skin care Product feels artificial and smell is too strong , The texture is really unpleasant It feels like sunscreen and it pills It feels like theres a film on your face as if it doesnt absorb well The packaging is also terrible The cream gets stuck under the ledges so you have to search for it which isnt really clean when using your fingers So you definitely have to use a scoop for it Its overpriced too for the amount you get , I like how this product goes on it feels hydrating at first  but I notice it seems to just not sink into the skin It feels heavy and sticky on my skin and the scent I dont care for it smells like a rancid orange peelI hade high hopes for this because I love the water mask moisturizer but I tend to use it at night but since this one is so heavy for day wear I may switch it up and use this one at night so I can hurry up and finish it up , Best moisturizer My skin looks healthier and better My dark spots has become lighter I will continue to use product I highly recommend , I had high hopes Smells like plastic and very sticky texture , I love this product The moisturizing is so hydrating A little goes a long way because the moisturizer is quite thick so it will last a long time Ive only been using it for a couple days so havent noticed a significant difference in my complexion but my skin feels so nice , Love this product A little goes a long way Has really helped brighten my complexion , Too thick Uncomfortable on the skin Stick with the laneige water mask , I got this product gifted by Laneige This is a nice vitamin C brightening cream I also grabbed the serum from this collection and the two work great together I love to use them for my am routine Hydrating and effective , I was hesitant about this product and I had heard mixed reviews At the end of the day this product changes my skin overnight Usually my skin doesnt do well with products that have a scent to them but my skin loves this stuff , I got this as a sample Tried it Saturday night Sunday morning my face felt like it was on fire It was swollen and very red Then I developed white bumps all over my chin and above my lips Please patch test first This has been awful to deal with ended up in urgent care for steroid cream and allergy pills , Ive only used it for 2 days and I missed last night and used it this morning and the other day in the evening before I went to sleep for the first time Im also using Fenty Skin products and this I must say is awesome I want to buy the actually product The only issue is my oily skin but like I said in another review it is gladly working out for my acneprone and oily skin There is so much smoothness and brightness I must say because of this product in conjunction to Fenty Skin PreShow Glow for my face of course and Cocoa Cleansr AllOver Soothing Bar concerning my face even though I use the bar for my body too I got this as a sample when I picked up Fenty Skin products the other day Worth it and will buy the product I recommend it highly much , So far I am loving this product I knew I needed to start using vitamin c in my skincare regimen and was looking at a million brands This cream had so many great reviews and I decided to give it a try First of all I love the packaging It feels very lux Second it smells so good and absorbs so well into my skin Looking forward to seeing the long term effects , This is a jellytextured face cream with a fresh orange flavor and a highconcentration vitamin C formula The texture is moisturizing but it will feel a little greasy in summer , In love with this moisturizer The smell and packaging are so luxurious and the product itself is so good It has the perfect texture that isnt too heavy so it sinks into the skin so nicely Its the perfect day moisturizer because of the vitamin C and keeps my skin feeling moisturized all day , I love this product I have very dry skin and this does such a great job at hydrating it I feel like my skin is so bright and the cream is so thick It feels amazing and leaves a beautiful finish My skin feels so soft and smooth , The first thing that I noticed was the fresh orangey scent I love how light and clean the moisturizer feels on my skin and it makes it perfect for day time since it doesnt feel sticky after application , This is a great cream for the mornings It really hydrates my very dry skin and brightens my complexion I thought it may be too thick but it really absorbs nicely and looks great under makeup It smells really fresh but isnt overpowering and I love the packaging and spatula The only con is the price but it really is a great cream , Love this product My skin feels and looks better , A gentle vitamin C moisturizer with an energizing orange scent This moisturizer has a gelcream consistency that absorbs quickly and doesnt leave skin sticky Its not too heavy or thick and is great for day time It layers nicely with sunscreen , I use the Laneige RadianC cream at night as my moisturizer and I notice bright and more even skin tone when I wake up in the morning without changing anything else in my skincare routine It comes with a really cute little spatula and the product applies semithick on my really dry skin and doesnt sit greasy on my face It has a typical vitaminc scent which doesnt linger and overall leaves the skin feeling really soft and looking bright , Since I deal with hyperpigmentation and dullness Vitamin C is the most important ingredient in my morning skincare routine  The fact that I can get an extra boost of it at an 85 concentration in my moisturizer now is very appealing  Upon first opening the sturdy frosted glass jar what stood out to me was the delicious citrus scent  Ive grown to love it even more with repeated use because it makes me feel more awake and energized  It also comes with a spatula so Im not constantly contaminating the remaining product with my fingers  I would describe the moisturizers consistency as a gelcream hybrid  It is hydrating without being heavy or greasy and provides a semimatte finish  It doesnt take long to fully absorb and doesnt leave a sticky film on the skin like other Vitamin C products Ive tried  There has been no pilling under sunscreen and makeup  Every time after use my skin feels softer and smoother  After two weeks my complexion looks more luminous like I have that lit from within glow  I look forward to continuing to use this moisturizer to see if it can help fade dark spots too  So far Im very impressed , I received this complimentary I was excited to receive this and I was ultimately disappointed Aside from shipping issues the product finally arrived Super cute container also comes with tiny scoop spatula thing Smell is citrusy but mild I have combodry skin Meaning its combo but it leans more to the dry side  Applying is easy and this product is super moisturizing so a little goes a long way   It did moisturize and it did brighten my skin however Im really upset that after using this Ive been extremely oily for about a week now And i only used it twice Hate the change So imma have to give it a 2 , I am loving this Vitamin C moisturizer from Laneige I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and my skin is looking brighter and feels moisturized It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not look or feel greasy at allIt has a light scent that I think is nice I love the packaging it really makes the product feel more luxurious Another one of my new favorites from Laneige Love their products , I really loved this cream It felt really nice on my skin not too heavy but heavy enough to feel moisturizing It definitely left my skin feeling soft and glossy right away and for hours after applying Also I have sensitive skin that can be easily irritated but this didnt cause any breakouts or irritation for me which isnt always the case with products that have vitamin c in them Overall I loved this product Laneige is killing the game ,

rebuy and recommend it , I am so excited to have this product I have had trouble with Vitamin C products drying my skin out in the past and this so far hasnt given me that trouble It has the best smella citrusy orange as youd imagineand it is hydrating and gentle It goes on and isnt sticky and it leaves my skin feeling soft I havent noticed a whole lot of brightening at this point so early on

feels so soft and smooth after applying Packaging is very simple yet stylish too , This Laneige RadianC Cream is a perfect hydrating cream for summer mornings It is white lightweight creamy texture very hydrating and a little bit moisturizing The fresh orange scent is also a reason why I love the product The brightening feature might need more time to test out but I do enjoy using the product so far , Smooth and hydrating This truly melts off all my stubborn makeup without stripping my skin I am in love with the light weight formula that leaves my skin dewy into the night before bed This melts into my hands , Laniege giffed me this new vitamin c moisturizer and I was intrigued because Ive only tried the blue line so far and I love me some vitamin c and I like how its not too strong or doesnt irritate my skin so far and the cute little pot , I have very dry skin  this is one of my holy grails I personally use this in my skin care routine for its vitamin c properties I use the la rocheposay triple repair moisturizer along with this cream It leaves a beautiful hydrating finish  doesnt cause any pilling , It is a very good facial cream for summer It is very light and soft The

is also cute Id recommend following with an SPF in the AM , This cream is absolutely my favorite  Its so light and soft and the scent is amazing  The cream illuminates the face and the skin looks smooth hydrated and radiant , Laneige my favorite brand  all products from Laneige my favorite and must haves this amazing Radianc cream I apply it two tomes a day mornings and before bedtime my skin is hydrated all day long and soft Highly recommend it , This cream does exactly what its supposed to Ive been using this now for four months and have seen an improvement in my skin tone and brightness It has a lovely texture and smells like citrus It absorbs into the skin nicely after a couple minutes I have no problem wearing make up over this cream I will be repurchasing this , I finally finished my little container and after using it consistently every morning I can confidently say that it was just ok for me I loved the smell and the texture it soaked in nicely and left my skin feeling moisturized In terms of the actual benefits of the VitC I would say I noticed no difference in my skin If youre looking for a more brightening treatment for dark spots texture and overall glow I would look at something more targeted with a higher concentration , Ohh my my face looks glassy and healthy with this cream Cream is good and light feeling  I have DRY skin and the cream is light yet I can feel it cream as well It hasnt made me break out which is fantastic and my skin feels softer and hydrated this radianc cream This is the one of the best cream  i have ever used It is so light and feel so smooth on the skin I will definitely be buying this again as soon as i run out Literally does what it claims to do I have dry and I mean super dry skin and it gives me instant hydration It absorbs so fast into your skin giving you a soft plump skin If you have normal to dry skin Loving this product will buying again , This moisturizer was amazing I love vitamin c and this definitely didnt disappoint The product also came with a little spatula so you are able to take moisturizer out without having to put your fingers into the container , The cream does not absorb immediately but rather after 24 minutes The product does not leave any residue Even without toner there is a slight moisturizing effect on the skin as the feeling of tightness fades , This is such a lovely moisturizer I have been looking to incorporate Vitamin C into my routine and this is an easy way for me to do so Great texture too My skin feels super moist Gifted by Laneige , This Radian C cream frim Laneige is perfect cream I have ever used  My skin is so hydrated moistured and looks more healthy I use this cream With Laneige water bank serum and Laneige Spf it does its work , Laneige does it again Im a huge fan of the brand and was so excited to try this product Not only was my skin super hydrated I also noticed brightening effects It absorbed quickly into my skin and left a smooth finish This will definitely be integrated into my skincare routine The sleek packaging is always a plus for Laneige products too , This RadianC Cream  was gifted by Laneige for me RadianC Cream is amazing really love it highly recommend it all products from Laneige is my favorite after use around eye is more firm moistured and brighter , I received the RadianC Cream from Laneige complimentary for my review Ive been wanting to try this cream for an extremely long time so I was definitely excited to try it out My skin goes through periods of time where its dry and this cream is moisturizing but not too heavy I also love how light the scent is and I look forward to seeing brightening results , After using this cream my skin feels much softer and I definitely see some of my blemishes brightening up I love how the cream feels on my skin and absorbs very well also I like how it does not feel oily or greasy after application , Will buy again for sure Nonsticky but I did not see a difference for hyperpigmentation , I received Laneige Radian C Brightening treatment essence gifted by Laneige I used Laneige products for the first time I apply it directly to my washed face It has a waterlike texture very light and the smell is refreshing Its easy to absorb and it makes your face soft and shiny Perfect for this summer highly recommended , Love this product I only use in the morning its light and absorbs into skin quickly , I used it consistently day and night for two months until I ran out I didnt notice a huge difference when it comes to dark spots and hyperpigmentation The texture is nice but it leaves a sticky film on the skin Although Im not a fan of citrusy scents this one was not overpowering and faded quickly Overall I dont think I will be repurchasing Oh well the search for the dark spot holy grail continues , Really great product Rich texture non clogging Great year round , Best cream I have used till date Very light weight and nice fragrance , Im gonna preface this with I have super sensitive allergic to a lot of things and just general eczema and sensitivities and very dry skin I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer for spring and summer time Its hydrating and moisturizing without feeling too light that it doesnt feel like its doing anything like some other moisturizers It does have some fragrance so if youre sensitive to that I wouldnt recommend this one It also is not enough hydration and moisture for anyone with dry skin in the winter but as a summer moisturizer its FANTASTIC , Doesnt do anything the only nice thing about it is the smell , I really like Laneige but this product didnt do much for me I have combination skin and I liked that this product wasnt as sticky or oily However I did not notice a major difference after using the product consistently for the last couple months Ill probably move onto another vitamin c product unless they change their formulation , It had a nice texture but I didnt love it I found my skin never fully absorbed it and it left my skin sticky throughout the day , Absolutely repulsing tire smell I cant remember any other detail about this product other than it smells horrible , Love love love this cream I can see my sun spots are slowly fading away I need to stock up on this cream , I love this product After trying so many other moisturizers I finally find something which works for me I have a acne prone skin and this works amazing for me , Im a bit disappointed with this cream I love la neige products They work wonderfully on my skin I had high hopes for this one First I dont like de smell I find the texture not smooth enough compared to water bank crme thats I love I did not see a difference in my skin vs a normal vitaminC serum Wont repurchase  , The texture of this cream is somewhere in between a gel and a cream texture Its not too oily so its perfect for if you have oilycombo skin and are looking for that I did find this gave my skin a glow but I stopped using it in the middle of the pot to try a different moisturizer so maybe I didnt use it long enough for it to fade acne scars But overall I like my creams rich with some oils in them so thats why Im giving this 4 stars Its just not rich and thick enough , This is my first time using this product and when  you use it consistently it does the job I was very surprised with the results it does even your skin tone is smooth it out and especially I have dark spots you can definitely tell theyre more lighting now So this definitely is my go too and I do recommend it , I adore this product It makes my skin feels amazing , This cream feels light on your face and has a really delightful orange smell I use it every morning and it sits well under my sunscreen , I am on my second bottle and I love it Feels amazing on my skin only using it in the morning and u can see the glow Love it , Love love this cream Its so smooth and semi thick so the consistency is very nice It has a faint fruity smell that its not overpowering at all I like the little application stick that comes with it as it helps me to not over use the product Would give 5 stars if the container itself were bigger its mainly jar and a tiny cream jar inside Still worth it though , Love this product Its a great  moisturizer with a nice light citrus smell It absorbs great into the skin and non greasy I have been using this once daily at night before bed and have noticed my skin is brighter My skin is on the drier side and was tired of trying greasy formulas Will be buying again , pretty good moisturizer does its job as a moisturizer didnt really notice too much of a difference but my skin seemed more hydrated I only issue is the container itself when you are finishing up the product its hard to get all of the product out of the pot as there is a little ledge where the tool cannot access and even a qtip or finger can reach and I can only imagine how much product that can be wasted if you are not able to access it all good product need a new componentl , Absolutely love this It feels light yet very moisturizing Love the price even more Used to use the ole henriksen moisturizer but this one takes the cake , Love the smell of this moisturizer Smells like an orange creamsicle so for people who dont like fragrance this may annoy you  Absorbed quickly into the skin but minus one star as I used up the whole jar and didnt notice any results in terms of clearing up dark spots or making my skin glow  Id rather use a different moisturizer and a vitamin C serum seperately , Had high hopes for this cream Loved that it was marketed as a Vit C  Moisturizer combo and was excited to use in the morning I have normal to dry skin specially dry in colder months and in seasonal transitions However after 2 uses I broke out in dry itchy red rough patches all around my mouth nose and chin Tried using for another 4 or 5 days but the patches only got worse Really really disappointed Definitely not for sensitive skin , so good i have super sensitive skin and this leaves my skin feeling super soft and bright I find whenever i use products on my face they always make my skin tingle or burn but this cream feels like nothing i love it , I tried this as a sample and fell in love It is so smooth to apply and leaves my face feeling so soft but not greasy or heavy I definitely saw a difference in my skin within a week of using The smell is also wonderful , This cream was terrible for my skin I have combination to oily skin and it make me breakout so bad With little white heads all over Clogs pores Do not recommend if you have sensitive skin to breakouts , Ive fallen in love with Laneige This is another wonderful product I use in the morning after serums before SPF love the brightening glow and moisturizing This jar however I dont love And it seems others in the line are shifting over to this style instead of the more generous sized containers , this product changed my skin in a matter of 3 days I wish I took a before photo I have been struggling with PP acne on my cheeks as well as extremely dry red and uneven skin its been a nightmare This cream moisturized and smoothed my skin tone and texture so beautifully im hooked cant live without it now , I am very pleased with this cream  I have combination skin with a few but noticeable dark spots  Where my skin is dry it is very dry  This cream is very moisturizing and I can already see some diminishing of spots after two weeks   I use it only at night because I have a day cream with SPF   When I wash my face in the morning I cannot believe how soft it is  Aside from dark spots my entire complexion is so much brighter  The cream is light in texture  I highly recommend this cream  antion skin wiht a few , This product broke my skin out I assume due to the vitamin C being repeatedly exposed to the airlight every single time you open up the jar Its also STRONGLY scented in a way that tries to be citrus butler reminiscent of chemicals Its kind of moisturizing but it leans more to greasy It seems to just sit on the skin and make it slippery I dont have oily skin so I dont see why it wouldnt do that , The product itself seems to be working very well with my skin It is very moisturizing and doesnt feel too harsh I do have some complaints though starting off with the scent It smells awful like very chemically It doesnt linger for very long but it is a challenge to have it on my face while its drying My second complaint is the jar The opening of the jar is smaller that the widest part of the jar So to use that last bits you have to curl your fingers into the inside of the jar Even with that its very difficult to get all of it , I really had high hopes for this moisturizer but its pretty ineffective I was pretty disappointed for the price point Its very moisturizing and doesnt feel heavy on the skin but doesnt deliver on its other claims , i really like this product I had found a bottle at TJ Maxx unexpired and I really like it I do think it adds some brightness to my face and adds great moisture to my face makeup goes over it well too will be repurchasing , Great moisturizer My skin looks absolutely fantastic after wearing this Also I love the vitamin C infusion which I think definitely makes my skin glow The only thing I dont like about this moisturizer is that Laneige is not cruelty free , Very lightweight and gets the job done Can be worn underneath makeup and can even be used in lieu of a primer because it does have a blurring and pore filling effect in my experience , First time purchasing this product  Ive definitely seen improvement of my over all skin It has been amazing for "
Water Sleeping Mask with Squalane,"my skin has been super dry and sensitive ever since I have stared acne treatment and omg this helps so much my skin has gotten brighter and my dry skin feels hydrated and more smooth i love it , I bought because of the great reviews and I wanted to love it The scent is a little irritating and instead of feeling moisturized my face is sticky and shiny It feels like its just a layer of stickyness on my face It is a little smoother but I wouldnt waste money on this again , I cant tell if this is making me break out because since I started using it Ive kinda been breaking out but it also may just be a coincidence Other than that it makes my skin so glowy and hydrating , in the mornings my face is super bright hydrated moisturized and smooth , This really helps my skin bounce back from long makeup days My favorite sleeping mask for sure , First week I used this it worked very well but it started to dry out my skin  I would wake up with dry patches on my face , wanted to love it felt great once i put it on but when i woke up in the morning i had patches of dry skin throughout my face that was peeling a bit is a great product but not for me , Gives a nice glow even radiance and feels hydrating Its not heavy at all its rather lightweight so if your very dry like me you will need something more nourishing i like this formula more in the summer for refreshing my skin , Used it overnight and it felt OK at first but I woke up with dry skin that was peeling a little I get better moisturizing results when I lather on Cetaphil before bed What the actual  , Ive used this product about 3 times now and have noticed great results After rinsing it off in the morning skin is VERY glowy I also found its been helping to reduce the appearance of any blemishes starting to form , Created an insider account to tell yall how much I love this stuff Literally will remove bumps overnight Laneige is that girl , love this so much made my skin so soft and so light weight staple , Amazing mask I love it so much and it makes a HUGE difference on my skin , I love this sleeping mask  and use it not only at night   It absorbs quickly so I can use it and apply makeup within 10 minutes or so  And a little goes a long way  I do use the small scoop that comes with it   Really helps my boomer skin feel hydrated , I love using this mask at night it makes my face feel so fresh and cool Perfect for those Sunday selfcare nights , This mask is in high rotation in my skincare routine but I think my boyfriend loves it more than I do It feels like a dream and the scent is super light Wears nicely as a night moisturizer especially in the summer , i use this as a nighttime moisturizer and i wake up in the morning with my skin feeling so hydrated and plumped if its one product i recommend from this brand its this one i have acne and it doesnt burn plus sent isnt strong its a clean sent , Wonderful mask Not too intrusive on your face and it feels great , super light and makes my combo skin super smooththe smell is really nice and soothing as well , I truly enjoyed this mask too much The mask felt light but moisturizing from the start There is a fragrance but nothing too intense imo I tried their other sleep mask but felt this one was more hydrating , I and my sister have used it over the past 3 months and have noticed it isnt hydrating enough for our combination skin  Hers more oil mines drier and it doesnt look the moisture that well as when I woke up the next day I needed more moisturizer and its just too lightweight I would recommend to continue using your usal moisturizer like the cereve moisturizing lotion or others , Im mad that i liked this so much I got it as a sampleand it fixed my dry face skin in one night so i bought it and used it as a mask on my dry canadian winter hands and its the ONLY thing that helped it really is a miracle worker forhydration , Literally the only moisturizer that doesnt break me out , when I put the gel cream on my face my face feels so hydrated even when I barely put it on This also gives my face a beautiful natural glow I am obsessed and in love with this product , This is a great mask Keeps my skin hydrated and soft , I got this as a sample or a birthday gift I think but I recently tried it out and its made my skin super soft in the morning Its a little sticky tho so keep that in mind before you try to sleep , I wanted to love it because i saw it had nonpore clogging ingredients but then once it arrived i saw it had fragrance and didnt think much of it till i broke out Fragrance is very pore clogging even if u dont have sensitive skin , I loved the old formula Im not sure of they changed it or not but this new formula and doesnt do it for me anymore It doesnt sooth my skin like the one I purchased before I hope they change it back , wanted to love it so bad but it just does nothing for me the cica sleep mask was a lot better but ultimately this was just an extra step with no real pay out , I received this sleep mask a few years back in the gift set and Ive always repurchased it since Its a gellike texture and is super lightweight on the skin I only use it twice to three times a week according to my skin texture that day , Ive been searching for a night cream and Im so glad that Ive come across this product Since Ive purchased the product Ive noticed that my skin is more dewy and freshed in the morning Laneige products may be more expensive for some but if you are able to afford this product I heavily recommend , I LOVE THIS ITS ONE OF MY FAVSSSS GO RUN TO SEPHORA , I really like this product However I really liked the lavender one which was so relaxing at bedtime Without the lavender Im looking elsewhere Bring it back and Im back Sorry laneige , I adore this product I have very dehydrated skin and this stuff works wonders Ive tried a tone of stuff like this but this is by far the best Its a great price for the amount of product you get It lasts at least 34 months before I have to buy a new one , Loveee this mask Super hydrating and makes your skin feel soo smooth Best way to reset for the next day  , This product plumps up the skin so well and leaves it hydrated and glowy by morning , If youve an oily skin its best for you It hydrated my skin and made the oil appearance on my cheeks way less than before Its safe and smells fresh too , Really like using this on skin cycling recovery nights Super hydrating , This leave my skin SO DRY Its supposed to do the opposite but I always would wake up with my cheeks feeing super tight and dry whenever I used this Had to resort to using it in my body to use it up Would not recommend or repurchase , My skin has never felt so hydrated and glowy Highly recommend this product in your night routine , SO MOISTURIZING AND MAKES SKIN SO SOFT AND SOOTHING AF , Holy grail I cant go without this its that good I wake up with calm smooth refreshed skin It works really nicely with the Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair Lightweight pretty much fragrancefree non irritating and a little goes a long way 1010 , The Laneige Water Sleeping Mask provides decent hydration for those needing overnight treatment The soothing scent is a plus and makes it perfect to use before bed However I find the price does not really justify the product however if you have extremely dry skin you might get more out of it than me , Jai reu ce produit en chantillon et je lai adorer Il est lger et ma rendu ma peau nettement moins sche Parfait pour lhiver , Super hydrating and cooling This is a great product to use after their cream skin toner  moisturizer But however it trapped the oil in my skin overnight and made me wake up in breakouts I replaced this product with the Jet Lag Mask by Summer Fridays I wished this worked for me  , Very hydrating Best use for dry skin or combination , Makes me feel so refreshed and happy Great addition to my every day night routine , This overnight moisturizer is so good and safe on my sensitive skin If Im feeling dry especially in the winter it is great too have this around I used it last winter and this one too  Im very happy with it  It makes a nice gift  I gifted it to my sister who has dry sensitive skin and she was very happy with it to said in the morning her skin looks great when she uses this  , I enjoy this a lot I find it comparable to the Neutrogena gelcream at around the same price point but this one has better humectants namely glycerin which helps keep the moisture in Works well on it own or with a routine I use this under makeup Paired up it can make your moisturizer work better Ive repurchased twice , I use this as my moisturizer and its heaven sent If you like a gel moisturizer then this for perfect for you , Love this product has worked super well for me Only complaint is the packaging It was EXTREMELY difficult to get the seal off once opening the lid I ended up using more product than I normally would just trying to get the lid off and not wanting to waste the product , This is the only mask that has helped improve my skin texture I received it in a sample and have been trying it for a week It has visibly improved my skin tone as wellWill try until I finish my sample to see any side effects , I didnt notice a difference right away but after using it for two weeks I do feel that I wake up with a more hydrated face I layer with a facial oil to get maximum hydration , Love this so much I use it every night before bed and I wake up with hydrated clear skin Ive purchased it 3 times , Tried a sample of this products it smells amazing but 5 minutes after I put it on my face was dry and started flakingperhaps its the new formula but it wasnt for me , I wanted to love this but it made me break out really badly I tried a few times after my skin cleared up and it was the same thing so I had to stop , I love this night mask It is super hydrating It feels like a dream to put on slicking onto your skin in just the right way You wake up feeling glowy and hydrated I love that it has Vitamin C and squalene to brighten and hydrate your skin Taking a point off because Laneige does animal testing , I had been curious about trying this product for a while and I finally received a sample at my last checkout I applied it before bed and to my surprise my frown lines that come and go based on my hydration level were gone the next morning However upon doing some research I realized that Laneige and their parent company AmorePacific are not certified cruelty free Their website claims that they have voluntarily ceased unnecessary animal testing but these claims are not backed by any third party certifications The use of the word unnecessary pretty much negates their efforts Their products are still sold in mainland China as well where animal testing is required for certain products So for this reason I will not be purchasing this product Please do better Laneige , The first time I used it my face felt softer and Les dry Highly recommend , this has been a total game changer for me i love how smooth and hydrating it is it doesnt feel like a mask at all and its one of the only moisturizers that leaves my skin super soft and not oily at all , If you are looking for intense long lasting hydration look elsewhere Nothing special As hydrating as any other light moisturizer , I love this product It makes my skin bright and really soft And also I just love how nice it feels when I go to sleep , Glides on like butter to your face I think perhaps because its a gel moisturizer that it doesnt feel as hydrating as a thick heavy cream would But I personally love the way it makes my skin glow in the AM , One of the best overnight moisturizers I have ever used Its like a glass of water for your face  youre left with even skin tone visible plumpness and nothing that feels OVERLY saturating My skin type is sensitive , I had received a sample of this sleeping mask a while back and as soon as I tried it I purchased the full size I was a bit skeptical at first due to the fragrance but it hasnt broken me out so far  I have sensitive skin I use it every other night on top of my moisturizer and the next morning my dehydrated skin looks plump and hydrated definitely recommend , I am not one for sleeping masks as I love my night cream I received this one as a sample from Sephora to try and I didnt love it It crumbled on my skin and didnt feel nice to put on As my husband and I are aging late 30s what doesnt work for me we try on him He doesnt rave about this but every night he uses it he comments on how nice his skin feels and he does comment on how good it looks the next morning He has nonoily nondry skin This might be a product is better for some skin types than others , I usually am pretty standoffish with products like night creams and night masks as I usually have broken out from using themThis night mask is so nourishing I use it every night and my skin is nice smooth soft and plump There was a little irritation when I first put it on but after several more uses my skin adapted just fine and it worked greatI would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin I honestly suggest the bigger size as I have used it for 3 weeks and Im already running low I think that the price is okay for the size and for how well it works but all of our skin types are different I am glad that I took a chance though and tried it , Pair this with Ordinary Hydrolaunic Acid serum to turbo charge it and use it day and night for beautiful winter skin , Product is the exact opposite of what it said it would my skin ask completely dry and irritated I will never purchase this product again , I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I have used it every night for the past few months under my eyes and I see a real difference in my under eye bags , Love how soft and hydrated my skin feels after I put this on after my moisturizer Will definitely keep buying this Gave one to my daughter and she also loves it , This is currently my favorite overnight moisturizer I recently tried Lanieges Cica sleep mask and I like the feel of this mask better and it doesnt leave the white tint that the Cica mask does , I abbbbsolutely love this product it makes my skin look dewy and moisturized the way no other product does When I use it regularly I notice a huge improvement in my skin I would use it every single night if price wasnt a concern , I love this mask So hydrating and Id definitely recommend keeping it cool as it has a nice cooling and relaxing effect , I have gotten 2 mini sizes of this and it is definitely not a must have I notice no difference compared to my usual routine of skin mist  gel moisturizer Its an extra product you dont need , The artificial fragrance is so unbearably strong Ive used it several times but threw the rest out today after I found the texture had clumped and become granulated  really gross and not stable product it does feel nice going on but I worry about the strong artificial fragrance and unnecessary chemicals on my face all night Besides that this felt okay going on but honestly is NOT as good as Belif s overnight mask That is the most hydrating mask ever and not with irritating unnecessary ingredients like this one Also would recommend Kiehls overnight hydrating mask but that is a different type and feeling Belifs mask is closer in the texture of this product but with better and lasting  results in my experience , This is such a holy grail I use this as my daily moisturizer not a night sleeping treatment It is light but hydrating and it works super well under makeup , Best moisturizer Ive found so far Light enough that I dont turn into an oilslick but nourishing enough to prevent flaking , This product is AMAZING I put it on at night and I see a real difference in the morningmy forehead lines almost disappear I think I might have dehydrated skin and this really helps , Bought this product on the recommendation of an employee after discussing how sensitive my skin is and my allergy to perfume I have been very dry lately Just tried it for the first time and I hate it It makes my eyes itch and water It is a few days after the deadline to return it so now I am stuck with something I cant use , Moisture without clogging pores I love the fresh scent and the texture Its almost a jelly If you need extra moisture but have oily skin or acne prone skin this product is amazing I also love that it comes with a spatula because this jar is DEEP and you dont need much Its great over another light moisturizer or straight over your actives Definitely a repurchase product , Love this product Hydrating lightweight Love the way it feels on my skin My skin is a combination of oily and dry and its helped my skin so much , This product is overrated but its still nice I have drysensitive skin so I think its more geared toward someone with oily skin It is moisturizing and lightweight which I like And it doesnt irritate my skin If you are looking for an alternative to a heavier night cream then this may be a good choice for you , Im so disappointed Ive used this product for more than 3 years and have had the best looking skinI have normal to oily skin I bought a replacement without knowing the formula changed Cystic pimples overnight Im so annoyed Why change something that wasnt broken , First off a disclaimer If you have dry skin and like thick creamy moisturizers this is NOT the product for you Seriously dont waste your money here Just move on and buy something else But If you have oily andor dehydrated skin and prefer gel moisturizers you will probably LOVE this moisturizer It has a wonderful gel consistency similar to Cliniques Moisture Surge 100H Moisturizer It absorbs more quickly than the Clinique however making it a better option to layer under makeup Yes I use this Laneige moisturizer both morning and night not just as a sleeping mask Maybe it absorbs more quickly because it includes squalane which mimics your skins natural oils whereas Clinique uses aloe and hyaluronic acid Not sure Regardless this product leaves my skin soft plump and dewy I love it After cleansing I spritz my face with a skin mist and pat on a few drops of hyaluronic acid serum Then I seal in all that moisturizing goodness with this product The end result My skin looks and feels better than it has been in years Again love it 1010 would recommend , I absolutely adore this moisturizer I have oily skin that is sensitive to the changing weather and dry air I also use tretinoin which causes my skin to peel and become sensitive I use this after all my other nighttime skincare and its a wonderful barrier that really locks in moisture The first morning after using this cream I woke up to the most beautiful supple skin Ive ever had Not oily in the slightest and my pores were itty bitty  Ive even used this in the morning before applying makeup and it doesnt interfere with my foundation and my makeup still lasts all day I have the trial size now but Ill definitely be purchasing the full size , I wanted to like this but am really disappointed The formula is very thin and doesnt actually hydrate my skin for more than a few minutes After applying it dissolves into the skin and my face feels dry again very quickly An overnight creammask should do much better , Finding skin care products that actually work for my skin is extremely difficult but this one is amazing I got the travel size about a year ago and im just running out now I use this after my moisturizer before bed or even during the day if Im working from home and it makes my skin feel so hydrated I strongly recommend for the harsh winter months In video chats where I had this product on I was told my skin looked so healthydewy which is one of the best compliments in my opinion , I first tried this product because I got a free sample and I love it I use this mask four times a week on the nights I use retinol I find its really soothing and ensures that the retinol doesnt irritate my skin Love it , Was so excited to use this and was so disappointed Made my skin feel so tight and dry used it before and after my moisturizer to see if that would help but same result Dont waste your money For reference I have sensitive acne prone skin , Absolutely love this product it refreshes my skin and has helped reduce my fine lines Will definitely be buying again , Seriously clogged my pores all over in places Ive never had a problem I got to help with fine lines and texture and never saw any improvement there , Not a fan of this product Got a sample size and wont be purchasing the full size Scent is a bit strong but fades quickly I found that I just cant tolerate wearing a moisture mask while Im sleeping , I love this product It definitely feels thick like a mask so you know it is staying in place When I wake up the next day and rinse it off my skin feels so soft I love the smell of it too Not sure that was a feature of this product but I sure enjoy it I love that it comes with the little plastic beauty spatula , I originally got a mini free sample off the laneige and I loved how it felt on my face so I had to get the bigger one Sometimes when my skin feels irritated this sleeping mask helps sooth it , Love it I have oily skin so when finding a sleeping mask I wanted something that wouldnt leave me feeling gross this is really great for that The texture is like a thick gel Like you can definitely feel it but its not at all too much If you have really dry skin I dont think thisll be enough for you though so yeah , I have some of the driest skin I swear Ive woken up in the middle of the night many nights from an uncomfortable dry feeling on my face and body Ive only used this mask a small handful of times but its like every fine line has disappeared its liens every , I get super dry skin in the winter and this is the only thing that seems to soothe it I use it as a daily moisturizer and love the way my skin feels after use , Meilleure crme pour la nuit Trs hydratanteNe laisse pas de sensation graisseuse , Very disappointed  made my skin dewy in the evening but woke up in the morning and it was just as dry , It worth the price I love and appreciate the results every morning My skin is bright and moisturized , I have been using this as a moisturizer yes moisturizer It says its a sleep mask but works wonders if you put it on as a moisturizer My skin has never been clearer I have been using it since 2020 and its been a staple in my skincare , I originally tried this out when I purchased a set and this came as a mini after finishing it I had to buy a full size This is a must for my dry skin galsEspecially in the winter months this helps tremendously I occasionally peel due to my retinol and this always helps with it overnight it leaves the skin feeling baby soft and doesnt cause any redness or acne for me , After using this product for one night I already saw the results Great for those with dry skin I also use this 23 times in the week because Ive noticed the results are longlasting , I LOVE THIS PRODUCT The smell is so nice and the texture too It is the third time that i buy this cream my skin loves it so much , LOVEEEE THIS MASK Saw results in less than 24 hours  usually you cant see if products made a difference in one day but the product you can Totally buy it I would recommend getting a sample or small one first to see if it irritates your skin It comes with a mini spoon to scoop out the product Also its even better if you put it in the fridge because when you put it on its a very chilling affect and feels so amazing Hope this helped , I bought it and I put it on every single night It works wonders my skin looks super soft and I no longer have dry skin I love it and will continue to buy it , This water sleeping mask saved my skin when I went to a super dry and cold place for vacation 1010 recommend , I love this product Ive been using topicals because of my acne and that has been drying my face a lot but Laneige products have always kept my face hydrated and feeling amazing I have not seen much improvement as far as acne scarring or reducing acne but it is an asking mask to apply before sleeping , This is one of the best skincare products Ive ever tried Every time I use this the next day someone tells me my skin is glowing It truly feels hydrating and smells great I love how my skin feels and looks with this product , Ive been using it as a nighttime moisturizer and it doesnt take a lot for my skin to feel hydrated I recommend , I got this as a sample in the birthday gift and liked it so much I ended up buying the full size The full size has a lot of product and Im sure it will last a long time It feels really hydrating and soothing on my skin It also didnt irritate my sensitive skin , i love laneige but this product is not it it literally does the opposite of what it says i have combination skin and this just made my skin dry and parched so disappointed , i got this as a free sample and i tried it one night instead of my moisturizer i can confidently say that this is the only skincare product where ive seen overnight results my skin was noticeably brighter and more supple in the morning i went out and bought a full container the same day , I love this night cream Not feeling greasy in the morning When I clean my face with miceller water in the morning before face wash the pad is not getting dirty , I have super sensitive skin so Im very cautious about what I use but I really love this mask I use it as a moisturizer and dont find that I really need to wash it off in the morning Highly recommend , I received this product complimentary from Laneige I am obsessed with how it feels on your skin and the way my skin is so moisturized in the morning is amazing Nothing feels better than how cooling this is at night and I look forward to this step in my routine each time , Though I just started using it  I can tell the difference right away  Its super moisturizing and it smells really nice  It really just rejuvenates my skin overnight  Its a very light and cooling formula  Complimentary from Laneige , Doesnt feel hydrating on my dry skin My skin feels tight and the mask feels tacky It leaves me wanting to put an additional moisturizer on top of the mask even after I previously moisturized before the mask Theres a strong floral perfume scent , super moisturizing and smells nice i sometimes forget to wash it off in the morning but its really nice , I was super excited to try this product I received a sample while out on vacation the next day I woke up with The worse breakout Ive ever had from a product  , This mask is sooo YUMMY on the skin theres just no better way to describe it I put it on after the rest of my night routine and it feels so light cooling hydrating and refreshing It makes my dry skin feel so nourished

when I dont need a moisturizer with spf , This is my new favorite nighttime moisturizer The packaging was user friendly and a little goes a long way when it comes to product It wasnt overly scented and felt AMAZING on the skin My skin looked so glowy the next morning , Highly recommended I love this product Very light to wear Skin Feels fresh and smooth in the morning , I first used this some years back when my doctor put me on a course of Isotretinoin shortlived but intense and this was one of the products I used to help bring some muchneeded moisture into my dry face It looks almost like a light blue gel but with a thicker consistency and hydrates quite effectively On its own it didnt work quite as well as my skin needed and I ended up going through a few tubs in succession layering it on very thickly However when combined with other Laneige products and a gentle cleanser I no longer needed to apply so much and the results were actually much better I recently got to try out the newer reformulated version and found it just as effective if not slightly better than the previous one I doubt I will be on Isotretinoin again anytime soon but if somehow it was prescribed to me I would be ordering a tub of this without hesitation I would recommend this product to anyone with combination to dry or dehydrated skin and who isnt overly sensitive to fragrance in skincare   My

Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum,"Unbelievably hydrating and refreshing feeling especially for a serum Never go to bed for the night without it This with the nighttime sleeping care moisturizer is absolutely essential for me , I can notice the hydration in my face from this product , After using this product after the past few weeks it had hydrated my skin and made me glow , Best hyaluronic serum so far I have use it for a month and my skin feel better , Leaves my skin feeling amazing and hydrated I have combo skin , The fragrance in this absolutely destroyed my skin and I was left with a ton of breakouts I did not feel that this hydrated my skin as well as other HA Ive tried , I loooove this serum I use it along with the Laneige water bank moisturizer and my skin stays hydrated and gloat all day , I wish they brought back the old formula and the old packaging now this feels cheap and I dont know how much product is left Smell nice and hydrating but for the packaging and quality its a no , This serum is good but like the cream moisturizer it is not as hydrating as its previous iteration As a result I end up using more and end up going through it faster I wish it was less scented but it dissipates pretty quickly The packaging does suck Its made with a ton of plastic now which makes it less recyclable than its previous glass bottle Its also just messy if you dont hit the pump hard enough and at the right angle it drips into an unreachable spot The indicator on the side of my bottle never turned red when I was running out and since the packaging is opaque I was left to guess by weight that I needed a new bottle I guessed correctly this time who knows if I will be so lucky in the future As a positive the style of pump does fully clear the product from the bottle There is no way to open it to check so I cracked my empty bottle with a hammer to make sure that there wasnt any lurking inside unable to be pumped out It was fully empty so thats good tldr the product itself is fine  it does moisturize the packaging absolutely sucks , Favorite hyaluronic serum I just wish it was refillable cause its a lot of waste , Love this product Hate the new packaging It is not functional and more messy to use when you pump it It drops down when pumped , I used this product for a while I love the product  its a staple in my routine I notice my skin feels more moisturized when I use versus when I dont my gripe with this is the packaging is terrible theres an indicator on the side to tell you when you need to refill but it doesnt work at all one day it will be empty with no warning , I have dry sensitive skin and love this serum I use it day and night keeps me hydrated , I really needed another hyaluronic acid Ive already been using the plum plump and I really love that for my skin After I heard great things about the Watermelon Glow Niacinamide I tried that Didnt love it as much And really thought about repurchasing the plum plump But then I saw this new bad boyI really didnt have high expectations for this product I didnt even know how it was going to live up to what I already loved and tried The Plum Plump I knew I needed to switch it up My skin was so dry and patchy after a week in Vegas First try How ligt and refreshing it felt Was worried about the scent being an issue but its a very light faint luxurious smell In 3 days my skin was looking so hydrated and I instantly became hooked Ive been using it and havent finished the bottle yet Use a pump everyday and every night during the Canadian winter season and i have dry skin sometimes even patchy with makeup Since ive been using this my skin is surprisingly glowy dewy and hydrated with a foundation on If you love the plum pump and want to try something new like I did I def think you should I think these two are great if you switch once you finish one or the other , After using this product for the last couple of nights my face appears to be brighter and glowy , I tried a sample of this serum It felt really nice when applying but didnt really notice any other benefits The fragrance smelled too artificial for me as well , I really like this product But the new packaging has honestly deterred me from wanting to buy again because there isnt a way of knowing when the product is done or how much is really in there , This serum is good but so great for the price there are cheaper options to get the same result I am happy to go back to my the ordinary serum , I got this as a sample so I decided to try it in place of my other HA that I use in my AM routine Never felt like it sank in just sat on my skin Within hours my combo skin was extremely oily looking I will go back to my tried and true TO HA serum I gave it 2 stars because it smelled nice , the smell is way too perfumey for me i didnt notice any benefits to my skin when using it and it made my skin feel worse and broke it out , I love a lot of other Laneige products but for me this serum is just okay I like the bottle design and the mild scent but the serum isnt as hydrating as Id hoped It feels like it sits on top of my skin instead of absorbing I have combination skin that leans dry most of the time and this didnt seem to mitigate the dryness much even when paired with a hydrating toner and moisturizer On the positive side my skins a bit sensitive and this did not cause me to break out Others mileage may vary but I wont repurchase this once I run out , Age Almost 28Usage Once on faceTexture Lightweight watery creamI received this sample with my order I immediately applied it to my face after searching reviews pertaining to milia which Im prone to getting when I use the wrong products and found none My skin thanked me for quenching its thirst after I skipped my skincare routine the night before I instantly felt hydrated and saw a slight brightnessglow to my skin It left my skin feeling subtly stickydewy but I didnt mind since I wasnt applying any makeup on I might purchase this in the future , I received a few of these as a sample to try out I am not a big fan of watery products so this didnt do much for me It smells nice though I cant give an accurate review as I only was able to use this 4 times , This stuff is amazing I damaged my skin barrier last winter and was told to start using a Hyaluronic serum to hydrate I bought this over the summer and its been a game changer I didnt notice a difference for a few weeks but now my skin is smoother and not blotchy pores are smaller Definitely going to be a staple in my routine  , Made my skin feel really good It is thicker than i expected but definitely still needs to go under a moisturizer , its ok I didnt notice a massive difference in my skin , This has changed my life My skin has never looked better and honestly applying this is my favorite part of my morningnight routine It is so hydrating and luxurious , Over the past couple of years I have been trying to find a serum suitable for my aged skin I have been using this Serum for the past 3 weeks and so far this has been the best serum I have ever tried it soaks nicely into my skin with no sticky feeling at all I purchased the Laneige water bank blue Moisturizer and eye cream and love the complete line this is not just for the younger generation I am in my 70s and I wish I had found this earlier , its alright My skin is very eczema prone dry dehydrated skin and it just didnt do it for me The packaging also is very bulky and wasteful , Literally obsessed with this One my second order and will definitely continue to order this and more of their products , I have an intensely dehydrated skin and this little guy helps me a lot Totally repurchase , This is really nice Its super lightweight and a perfect serum for layering My skin is chronically dry and this is a nice added layer of hydration without being too heavy This likely wont be enough for winter but it is perfect for warm weather , Seriously the best hyaluronic acid I have ever used It feels wonderful as you are applying it to the skin Whatever it is you need your particular hyaluronic acid to do for you I have no doubt this will suit your needs and exceed your expectations , Wanted to love this so bad I love the packaging its beautiful But the product itself made my combo skin more oily than normal I gave it a few days so my skin would adjust but after two hours my nose was a grease ball , I love this serum because its fit for asian combo skin My skin is plum and glowy One con pls change the packaging I miss the old glass one and make it refillable save mother Earth This packaging is so bulky not good for travel change the whole packaging of the line bring back the old one pls , When I tell you Im obsessed My skin looks plump and hydrated  finally I love products that go easy on my skin since I have sensitive skin all over  My combination skin soaks this up in the best way , Awesome serum great regularly and also soothing on a sunburn , Amazing amazing amazing Not only does it smell great it melts right into the skin and makes it mega soft I love this product Worth every penny , Loved my sample and brands products in general Hydrating and did not cause acne Downrated for bottle and cannot see ml listed as to size on site Pricing as well a discount store used to carry this brand , This serum is amazing I love and have it Its no joke the best for dry skin , Absolutely amazing serum I have sensitive dry skin and this serum keep my face smooth and moisturized all day The only one complaint I have is actually the packaging Although it looks nice and fancy its really hard to tell how much product is still in the bottle and its just too bulky to bring it when traveling Would be a 55 product if the bottle is lighter and more sustainable really , The best serum ever My skin is soo hydrated now Just buy , I normally hate writing reviews but I need to for this product because its incredible Its very light and absorbs into the skin so nicely After about a week of using it Ive already noticed my skin texture is even and smooth The packaging is gorgeous so overall this serum is 1010 , Loved it Loved the light weighted texture the quick absorption and the packaging My face feels really hydrated after using it , Love this Ive always wanted to love Laneige products but unfortunately the products Ive tried always turned out too sticky aka dewy Im not a fan of having dewy looking skin because my face gets oily way too quick This serum is amazing super lightweight and absorbs into my skin right after I apply it  Random comparison but Im a long time user of Tatcha and have always wanted to love their water cream its lightweight but never sinks into my skin  If youre looking for a creamserum thats lightweight give this a try , Fell in love with this the moment I put it onLove that it is Super lightweight , The BEST Ive ever tried in a while Love the texture Ive been using it for five days and the changes in my face are very noticeable The bottle is so chic and innovative I love it 100 recommended for combination skins like mine , I loveee this product It has a watery type of runny consistency and works amazing on the skin When you apply it on the skin its cold so you automatically feel refreshed Its definitely giving me late night beach vibes Id totally recommend this product however Im just not a bit of a fan of its kind of stickiness onto the skin when you first apply it Though  later on it fully absorbs , The LANEIGE Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum is super hydrating and light I noticed my skin immediately soaked in the product which for me that is a win I put it on after my essence and it works perfectly The only thing I wasnt too fond of was the scent It has sort of an old smell but it did not break me out The packaging is so innovative twist to dispense product and never lose a top again This was gifted by LANEIGE , Nice product but alergic to something in it It did make my face feel really soft however but about half an hour after use my face felt so itchy I gave it two stars because it did do as expected nice soft skin but personally I didnt like it because my skin broke out and became very itchy , My skin has be loving this serum Its a gel like cream that is very lightweight A little goes a long way with this serum once applied it gets a watery consistency that applies evenly and absorbs quickly into the skin Theres no residue or tackiness left behind I love using this in the nighttime routine in the morning my complexion feels and looks smooth while also moisturized , OMG Why have I not tried this sooner I love this serum for my night time routine Its a great staple and keeps my combo skin from becoming oily Remember hydrating does not make your skin more oily , I received my Laneige Water Bank blue hyaluronic serum as a gift complimentary from Laneigeand its been the best gift From day one of using it I immediately loved it The bottle itself

You definitely wont lose this in the bottom of your bag Overall the serum absorbed great and I felt my skin stay hydrated throughout the day I paired with other Laneige skincare to create a full routine , Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum quickly absorbs into my skin The smooth milky texture is so nice It immediately hydrates my skin leaving it feeling very smooth and soft I love the

from Laneige and is incredible  Immediately after applying the product my skin feels as soft as velvet There is instant moisture and its use of Green Tea extract enzymes helped my skin to be more

bottle has an indicator that turns red when its time to switch out so you know ahead of time that you need a new bottle , Excited to share my thoughts on the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum that I was recently gifted by Laneige in exchange for an honest review I am someone who loves to include a good hyaluronic in their skincare routine so this was a treat for me and my sometimes temperamental skin The serum comes in a very sleek modern packaging with a lovely light blue color motif and with a unique pump where you twist the top to then dispense the serum The serum itself is lightweight but feels instantly hydrating on the skin It absorbs like magic and has kept my skin looking and feeling quite plump supple and hydrated when applied both morning and night It is slightly tacky prior to absorbing completely but is temporary and once the product sinks into the skin it just feels supple and smooth Packed with peptides green tea enzymes and blue hyaluronic acid it helps not only to hydrate the skin but also creates a more firm appearance remember that plumping I mentioned and a more smoother complexion overall It even has a nifty indicator on the back of the bottle to let you know when youre running low on product and need to reorder I have quite liked adding this serum to my routine and find it effective lightweight and gentle enough to recommend for any and all skin types looking to add a hyaluronic to their regimen , I got this gifted by Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum and I loved it I leaves my skin looking so good It has helped me with my dark spots

leaves my skin beautiful and soft the packaging is very nice and very innovative too I had not seen a package like it  I definitely recommend it I love it complimentary from Laneige , Product was gifted by Laneige There only one word for this serum and its Outstanding I gave this a try because I love Laneige Products This serum is light and smooth It looks expensive and feels expensive Its great for dry skin I would definitely recommend , The Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum has a milky gel consistency and a prominent floral fragrance  It absorbs quickly and makes my dry skin feel hydrated and refreshed but also leaves behind a sticky residue immediately after application  That residue disappears after moisturizer is applied and my go to pairing is the Laneige Water Bank Cream  This serum extends the life of the moisturizer hydrating my skin for many more hours compared to when I use the moisturizer on its own  Any exfoliation from the green tea enzymes is extremely gentle  As someone who has sensitive skin it didnt cause any irritation but rather serves to further smooth and soften my skin  The packaging is very modern and intuitive to use  You twist the top half of the container to reveal or conceal the pump  This is a great defense mechanism to ensure no serum is accidentally spilled  There is also a window on the back of the container that will turn red when the serum is running low so you know when its time to restock  I wish all products adopted these useful features  Gifted by Laneige , I love how this serum feels so lightweight and

weeks my skin has felt softer smoother and firmer  This is a wonderful product that I recommend to all skin types , This is such a nice product Its so lightweight and watery feeling but so effective

during the cooler months nearly nothing helps it After a day maybe all my dryness started clearing up Thats saying a lot because the side of my nose alone I have to usually scratch off the dry flakes and I have zero now The formula is super light weight it blends right into the skin and doesnt leave you feeling sticky I really enjoy the component too its simple and unique and can be refilled so its also helping the planet Must have for anyone with dry or dehydrated skin I did receive this complimentary from Laneige but these are my own opinions , Gifted by Laneige I apply this right out of the shower to damp skin and my skin immediately feels hydrated It driesabsorbs quickly and makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth throughout the day and overnight The packaging is luxe and its super sanitary although Im not sure that the big component is absolutely necessary Theres a light scent to the product but nothing that irritates my sensitive skin Would repurchase , Excellent serum with hyaluronic acid Beautiful packaging with a convenient pump Serum is quickly absorbed without of oiliness and stickiness I use it in the morning along with Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic gel Moisturizer a great combination my face is moisturized all day longI received Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum complimentary from Laneig in exchange for my honest opinion , Laneige gifted me this serum and Its amazing I love how lightweight and fast absorbing this serum is It leaves my skin hydrated and has become an essential part of my AM and PM skincare routine I absolutely love the packaging Not only will it tell you when youre almost out of product but it also has a pump which doesnt allow for bacteria to touch the rest of the product Although I do wish that it was fragrance free the smell is not too strong , This serum has an interesting twist container that is very easy to find in my skincare bag and easy to pump out Theres even an icon on the size that will warn you when youre about to run out I like that the texture is light enough for me to layer on multiple serums and moisturizers with this It sinks in fine and like all hyaluronic acid serums it works best on damp skin The downside is the price Theres no reason for something as simple as hyaluronic acid to cost this much , I got this serum complimentary from Laneige This is nice hydrating serum from a trustworthy brand I have oily skin this serum is not greasy and fairly lightweight for me It works great as a morning serum to keep my skin hydrated for the entire day , I received this product

Would order again for sure , I loved this serum The packaging is so cute with the pump coming up from the top                              The smell is very subtle and clean Would absolutely recommend this Gifted by Laneige , I received Laneige water bank blue hyaluronic serum complimentary from Laneige Laneige lip sleeping mask is my favorite lip balm So when I receive this serum I cannot wait to try it It is even better than I expected It is super hydrated but not heavy The texture is moisturized My skin feels smooth and soft after I used it for one week , Love this serum The packaging is cute and stylish  The design of the pump make it easy to use The smell is pleasant light and fresh The gel like consistency make it get absorbing quickly into skin This serum hydrated and soothes my skin  Great for hot summerGifted by Laneige , Gifted by Laneige for my honest review  Absolutely love this serum I apply this serum every AM as part of my daily routine since I received this profuct I used it with the new Laneige gel cream together Love the scent It absorbs into the skin very quickly My skin feels calm and clear after use I think it is a great summerspring serum , LOVE this serum This product was gifted to me and I plan on repurchasing it once it runs out First the packaging is beautiful and simple and I love the pump Second the smell is AMAZING So light and fresh I use this in the morning for a little boost in moisturizing It goes on so smooth and my skin instantly feels plump and refreshed I have already noticed an improvement in my overall skin texture I cant recommend this product enough , I was gifted by laneige I love love love the packaging Very new and different The scent isnt strong barely has a scent The serum is very light weight and airy which I like because it melts into the skin I have very dry skin and helped with hydration and dry patches under my makeup It did leave a bit stickiness on the skin but less than other products Serum helped a lot with dullness All laneige products are great , This product is great Its packaged securely and its soft on the skin It doesnt have a weird fragrance and does not make me break out on my skin I enjoyed using my this product and would highly recommend it , First I Love The Packaging So Much After Its Gone Im Gonna Keep It Just Because I Love That Its Light You Dont Feel It Weighing Your Face Done Like Most Products And It Has A Light Scent Which Is Lovely gifted by Laneige , This water Bank Blue Hyaluronic was gifted by Laneige for my honest review I am not a fan of Laneige but quite expressed by this serum It is quite light weight with mild and present scent It is if gel texture and absorb fast with greasy feeling The design of the bottle is friendly for carrying without leaking and can apply anywhere , I cant say I was too surprised by how much I love this product considering Im a pretty huge fan of the Laneige brand in general Upon applying this product to my face my skin almost immediately felt hydrated Thats huge considering I struggle with dry skin I also liked how quickly it absorbed into my skin leaving it smooth and soft unlike other hyaluronic serums Ive tried in the past that leave my face sticky As an added bonus I think the packaging is super cute and sleek and the low product indicator is a nice touch to remind you to restock before you officially run out I will say the serum itself has a little too much of a perfumelike scent for me I prefer my skincare minus lip products to be unscented but its not a dealbreaker , This is gifted by Laneige The packaging of this serum is very stylish The texture of the serum is not very sticky it is very easy to be absorbed by the skin and it can soothe dry skin The hot summer is coming and I am going to use it as a summer serum , I was gifted by Laneige Best lightweight Fast absorbing and super hydrating "
Cream Skin Milk Oil Cleanser,"This product kept my skin hydrated and smooth Its takes off sunscreen and makeup very well If it gets in your eyes before rinsing your eyesight may be a tiny bit blurry for a few secs , Honestly one of the best ones I have tried for sensitive and dry skin I dont think it will be the best for removing makeup but the best for not leaving my skin tight  , Its a decent cleanser not the best nor the worst But definitely not worth the money I dont find it to be hydrating and the consistency is too watery This cleanser also doesnt remove makeup that well either , Ok product that isnt worth the money There are drugstore cleansers that remove makeup so much better I could see how this would be nice for dry and sensitive skin I like that it didnt leave my skin dry but this only works on days where I only wore sunscreen and nothing else I also have to use a ton of product to get any of my makeup to budge , I LOVE THIS PAIRED WITH THE CREAM SKIN TONER these fixed my skin barrier  great to use for both winter  summer PLEASE DONT DISCONTIE OR CHANGE FORMULA , I didnt expect a lot at the beginning but omg Its perfect My skin is combine and for some reason out of nowhere my face started to itchy and was red the whole time after using other products for acne I was reading the reviews and ingredients and decided to give it a try After 2 times of using it my face looks less red doesnt itch and my face is super smooth and looks better and healthier I dont use it as a makeup remover if that helps , I disagree with some of the other reviews in that it DID get my makeup off but I did need about 4 pumps because its on the thin side My skin felt really nice afterwards and not stripped dry , I love the fragrancefree and super gentle soft feel of this cleanser the formulation is great and it cleans my skin well as long as I use this as a second cleanse so beware this will likely not do much for your full face make up or daily sunscreen unless you use 46 pumps and rinse between each scrub I use it in the mornings and as a second cleanse after an oil cleanse int he evenings and it works really well , I love this so much it dont remove all the makeup thats why its the 2nd step of my double cleansing routine I also use it in the morning  the best daily creamy cleanser , I dont wear makeup and that seems to be where this cleanser loses everyone I love the way this cleanser feels on my skin I look forward to using it every night I apply it to my dry skin like lotion then use a hot wet washcloth to remove it before using my second cleanser I have noticed a huge difference in the texture of my skin since using this and its my cant live without skincare product I recommend this to everybody , Didnt do much for me Instead of melting away my makeup it really just started to lift it but then left it there on my face even after rinsing and patting dry Too much effort to remove minimal makeup in my opinion , The formula feels nice but it does nothing I always still have to use another makeup remover and wash my face after so this is just an additional step that doesnt have a benefit I barely wear any makeup concealer and mascara only most days so its disappointing that this couldnt remove it Sad I wasted my money on this  , Worst product Very sticky thats the honest truth , I really wanted to like this but it did absolutely nothing It didnt take off any makeup and it left behind a greasy residue The cleanser does feel like a cream but it thins out once you add water nothing about it feels like an oil cleanser , This caused me to breakout really badly with some of the most painful zits Ive ever had This has never happened to me before so I stopped using it cleared up and then a few weeks later decided to try it again This was a bad idea Broke out again And the new Sephora in Kohls that I bought it from wouldnt let me return it , Horrible Did not remove my makeup at all Made my vision blurry Its basically white water My recommendation is if you wear waterproof makeup get a product that has simmondisa as one of the higher up ingredients This product does have it in it but I think the amount is too small , Makes my skin so soft and works great to take off any extra oil or spf Kind of smells like glue but it doesnt bother me Make sure to follow with a regular cleanser though or you could breakout , This literally melts away all your makeup even my waterproof mascara It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and creamy I just love this , Just finished my bottle and I have my thoughtsPros  doesnt irritate  does fog the eyes hydrating leaves skin feeling nice but not greasy I love milky things lolCons  DOESNT REMOVE MY MAKEUPas a person who wears makeup daily I need a cleaner that removes my makeup well This doesnt do that at all it just moved it around This would be good for someone who just wears spf during the day Not for me wont repurchase , Bought this product while I was on accutane because I needed something gentle and hydrating to cleanse my skin and help remove makeup Works so well My skin texture became noticeably better within a week of using it and much more hydrated It removes makeup well you just have to make sure to get it in all of the crevices of your face I will say if you use waterproof mascara that it works best when applying and leaving this on for a minute or two to let it melt into everything I usually apply brush my teeth and then wash the cleanser off Very happy with it and am in my second bottle post accutane , I usually double cleanse so Im not sure this alone removes all my makeup I do have to say it is a very light cleanser and is very soothing on the skin I have acne prone skin and I havent broke out since using this , this cleanser isnt oily its milky because of that its poor at removing makeup sunscreen and whatnot i dont think this leaves a film so for a gentle cleansing step it could be good for that i have noticed a difference in my overall skin hydration after using this product for a bit over two months i believe but i couldve achieved that with a different product sometimes it stings my eyes too wont buy again if you want to try the cream skin line do the toner i only say id recommend this because it has its usage its just not the one its intended and marketed for , Will be returning  does NOT take all your makeup off Still had mascara streaking down my face after every wash Tried this product out for a week and will be returning , Love the creaminess of this but it does not get makeup off at all I washed my face four times in a row using this cleanser and still had a significant amount of makeup on my face afterwards I will need to use a  cleanser that actually removes makeup before using this , Initially I did not love this product However after about a week or so of using this the texture of my skin became so much softer and moisturized throughout the day I am so happy with it that I just reordered , I have been using this for FIVE days What can I say except you have saved my skin LANEIGE Guys gals all suffering from sensitive skin acne rosaceaTRY THIS I know everyone reacts differently to different things but for my combination sensitive skin redness and acne prone skin this is perfect Im hopeful that I will continue to see improvement with this gentle soothing hydrating cleansing milk , Girl If you dont just get a balm youre literally throwing your money away This is EXACTLY as it describesmilk But not once did I feel like my face was clean or it took away any makeup I can just pour the oat milk in my fridge on my face to get the same affect because its not about being a milky cleanser just milk , Currently I am doing a round of tretinoine and my skin is so irritated I have about 6 cleansers in my line up and i can only use this Its perfect for anyone with irritated dry skin , Love this Makes my skin feel so nice and doesnt make my skin feel really tight after using , i just received this cleanser and i was looking forward to using it but i recieved it without a pump i do not like using cleansers without a pump and i was glad that this cleanser had a pump but after receiving it without im beyond upset especially because in other reviews everyone elses came with a pump , I absolutely love this I have dry sensitive skin I also have some skin barrier damage I was worried that it would break me out since Ive tried other expensive products and it caused me to break out This felt so nice on the skin , Nice texture felt luxurious This did take my makeup off and leave my skin hydrated but there was a stinging feeling afterward I would not use this again and wouldnt suggest it for anyone with sensitive skin , Its really gentle on the skin After washing everything off it doesnt leave my skin dry and it still feels moisturizing It doesnt remove all eye makeup off and have to wash it with another cleanser but it is a nice first cleanse Would recommend , Theres probably better oil cleansers But I do like this one might buy again The milky color is really cool and makes me happy to use Really feels like Im putting milk on my face Its very softening to the skin after you use it I have dry skin so that makes me very happy Its not strong enough to get rid of make up though So I use this as a morning cleanser Sometimes at night I use a makeup balm eraser and layer with this to wash everything Then go in with my other cleanser Hope that helps , I really like this product when used as a firststep oil cleanser I follow with my first aid beauty water based cleanser My skin feels great and very hydrated I took off a star because it doesnt remove makeup all that well but my second cleanser finishes the job so I dont mind too much I also feel like some product is wasted because its so runny it doesnt all make it to my face , This product is great at gently removing all my makeup even my eye make up Its not heavy and love washing my face with it , This cleanser has become a daily staple for my sensitivecombo skin from being so dry First I use Laneiges Vitamin Brightening Cleansing miceller Water before cleansing a 2nd time with the Milk Oil Cleanser I add two pumps to damp hands then emulsify in palms before massaging on my makeup free dry face Along with Sephoras grey teardrop silicone cleansing tool to thoroughly cleanse my face and neck , The first week I used this product I wasnt convinced but over time I noticed how soft my skin felt Its really a great cleanser and moisturizer Its not heavy duty like mascara doesnt come completely off but I am okay with it since it leaves my skin so soft Plus I dont know what other cleansers are strong even to fully take off mascara , SUPER hydrating and really helped clear my acne Overall an amazing cleanser I use this first for a double cleanse and to melt all my makeup off and then use the La Roche Posay hydrating cleanser If you have dry skin this is def a must have , I love the consistency but this made me break ouuuuut  , This is the only oil cleanser that doesnt leave a weird film on my face I wouldnt recommend if you wear heavy makeup as it doesnt do that great of a job to remove it but its one of my favorites and super moisturizing , Its a pretty good cleanser Probably better than most at Sephora Very gentle Takes off makeup mostly but it takes 2 tries and doesnt quite get all my eye makeup off Also doesnt have a luxuryspa factor which is disappointing , i honestly love this oil cleaner if you have sensitive acne prone skin this is for you it removes light makeup and spf i love the smell of it  , Perfect for removing makeup without leaving your face dry Its been a better alternative to cleansing oils and its less messy , Hated this product Didnt even feel like washing my skin it just felt like i was rubbing my face Terrible product , Beautiful cleanser for the morning that takes off your nighttime treatment and leaves skin nourished Two pumps on dry skin nice massage as well to relieve any puffiness Rinses like a dream Just wish there were less packaging Laneige consider making a refill , I have been using this as a first cleanse to remove SPF and everyday makeup although I do not wear makeup every day I bought this to try instead of my usual cleansing balm although I love cleansing balms I found that using it on the daily was making my hairline greasy I wanted something lighter that would still be effective as a first cleanse This works well at breaking down SPF tinted moisturizer and light eye makeup On the one occasion I used it to remove a full face of makeup I did admittedly use eye makeup remover so cant attest to its efficacy at removing a more glam eye but it did remove my full coverage foundation concealer bronzer etc I have sensitive normaldry skin with Rosacea and have not experienced any adverse side effects The texture is light and milky but once rubbed into the skin seems to thicken It also emulsifies well once water is added , good for a gentle cleanser or a 2nd cleanse after heavy makeup not irritating or drying , Worst Cleanser Ever I wanted to find a more moisturizing oil cleanser than DHCs Deep Cleansing Oil This Laneige cleanser left a film over my skin after washing it off Not only will it prevent actives and serums from reaching my skin it also feels yucky Im shocked Laneige has such a poor product and even more so that others like it , Makes a great first cleanse and removes light makeup well and I also enjoy using it in the morning super milky and soothing helps my flaky dry spots a lot It also doesnt aggravate my acne instead it softens my skin , I loved the ingredients when I bought it Felt like would be nice for my dry skin But its too mild It doesnt give me any clean feeling after using it Not going to return it but definitely not gonna purchase this next time , Def not the kind of texture I normally prefer Its very watery thin Not the thick milk texture that I was looking for So far the cleansing is okay , I was very happy when I found this cleanser because it keeps my very dry skin hydrated I havent tried any Laneige product before and I havent tried this one to take off makeup but I can say that its an excellent product to prevent skin from peeling off , Nice cleanser but ok at taking off makeup Would not recommend for taking off waterproof makeup , My holy grail everyone is different I am a drinking my body weight in water but still dry person my skin breaks out because of dirt being trapped below the dryness I constantly switch my routine to fit the California dry weather If you are dry this is it The end Ive tried everything Coming into winter this is my go to it is so difficult to find something hydrating that doesnt clog pores I tried a sample and I was hooked If you sound like me late 40s and dry please try this its amazing , Took a star out because it doesnt seem to take off makeup completely  Not a problem for me since I double cleanse with a balm that washes away all the makeup  Theres no fragrance doesnt make me breakout or make my face feel at all stripped of moisture after use  One thing to note if youre using this cleanser after first cleanse do make sure to dry off skin before using this product as second cleanse  Its harder to move around the product on wet skin , best facial cleanser ive ever used 1st picture is me recently no foundation on skin my face is so much cleaner and my acne is gone see my face on 2nd picture before i started using the product there is a clear difference and ill never stop using this product , This is the first Laneige product Ive tried and Im super impressed Its super gentle on the skin but highly effective at removing surface debris and makeup It works better than other products Ive tried that are specifically formulated to remove waterproof eye makeup which is probably what Im most impressed with My pores also appear smaller and my overall complexion is much brighter after just a few days of using this stuff I love it , I have absolutely begun to live this product  Its perfect for every morning and night 1210 recommend , I have sensitive skin but I also struggle with acne and milia This is my favorite oil cleanser It cleans my skin without leaving me feeling tight nor undercleansed I even feel comfortable just using this on nights where Im taking off makeup but too tired to double cleanse Would give 65 if I could , Not the best cleaner its not effective at taking off makeup so what is the point3 stars for it being gentle and nonstripping , The way this product feels on my face is a dream The formula is so milky creamy and moisturizing on my skin  Dry skin would love this I use as my first step in my double cleanse routine The only negative is that it does not completely remove my eye make up mascara and liner I dont mind since I double cleanse anyway I will repurchase because it feels too good , This is a cleanser that leaves your skin feeling nourished and softenedThe only thing is the smell its a bit off putting It smells like chemicals and odorous plastic thats the best I can describe it Im happy it has no sensitizing ingredients that tend to smell nice but ugh why does it smell like that Honestly I still think its a good product and I will continue to I use it till its gone but if I can find a substitute that gives me the same results that smells better Im jumping on that bandwagon , My skin has changed as I got older  In my 20s I had the TZone oiliness but had dry around my eyes and lips  Now that Im in my 40s its ALL dry  In the winter its painful red chapped and peeling  Ive had to completely change my skin routine and I decided to try this  Im on my third bottle of this and I just continue to love it  I dont wear makeup very often and when I do I use a makeup remover before I use this cleanser  This along with the water bank line has really helped me to have beautifully moisturized glowing skin  I recommend this for anyone who needs some extra moisture in their lives , I got this to use as a double cleanse It Barely cleaned my face and left me with a small breakoutvery oily skin the next morning , Ive tried many cleansers as I like to do the double cleansing method and Im picky I have dry sensitive skin so most products strip my skin and leave it compromised I LOVE this cleanser I use it to remove makeup It melts it off beautifully and does not burn my eyes at all Then Ill use another pump as my second cleanse It lasts for a while because I only use 23 pumps for makeup removal and regular cleansing I love that I only need this one product instead of using a cleansing balm and then another cleanser like I have in the past I will forever repurchase this product Its THAT good , This is a very mild cleanser and part of my double cleanse I dont wear complexion products or much makeup in general just brows so I cant speak for how well it will dissolve makeup I havent had any issues with this product at all and have been using for over 7 days now I would recommend this if you prefer mild products , This is a lovely cleanser that was a lifesaver in the winter I still use it as a double cleanse and it does take my makeup However I do not wear a lot of face makeup which usually consists of SPF blush and eye makeup with the occasional skin tint so i do have less to take off If you wear a full coverage face then this is probably not for you and you should probably buy a cleansing balm This cleanser does make my skin feel supple and I swear I had less breakouts ever since using it too , Feels like a milk cloud being massaged into your skin So soft and moisturizing Get it , Great for dry skin Works awesome to take off my sunscreen at the end of the day before my second cleanse , For me this cleanser is only eh But I can see it being a saving grace for someone with extremely dry sensitive skin Its extremely gentle and doesnt leave your skin feeling stripped in the slightest It definitely doesnt remove makeup though like at all , For 34 I wish I was more impressed with this oil cleanser It does its job but I dont feel like it truly gets off all my makeup It definitely leans more on the milky than oily side I use it as the 1st step when I double cleanse so it works best as a duo , It works well for my dry skin I just switched over to this because my prior cleanser was stripping out all the moisture  my skin felt dry  irritated This cleanser soothes my skin  is recovering it This cleanser does not foam It is the texture of milk  oil combined I dont feel like it is a deep cleanser I will use something different a couple times a week for that but it is great for times when you want to retain some of your natural oil , First the pro is this took off all my face makeup The only makeup that came off my face after was around my hairline I didnt try it on my eyes as I wear waterproof mascara and usually use a different makeup remover for that using a cotton pad I will say a con with this is I feel like I need 23 pumps to get enough to work with I feel like it was disappearing into my skin Not a bad smell and didnt burn like other cleansing balms or oils Its a good partner product to my holy grail cream skin toner  moisturizer , Even though this says it is for dry skin it will leave your skin feeling tight and dry I have combooily skin and still I would have dry patches every day and even my moisturizer afterwards wouldnt hydrate Once I switched to a different cleanser my skin felt so much better , This is the worst product Ive ever used The product doesnt melt your makeup You can just feel the makeup getting sticker and clumping and just getting harder to take off with this product This should melt the makeup off not making turn it into glue under your skin But a cleansing oil or balm Stay away from this , Feels like Im just rinsing my face with water Hand soap would do a better job , This will not take off makeup  At all  Very expensive when you need another cleanser to get this cleanser off , this cleanser is so great for my combination skin leaves it really clean feeling but also still moisturized some more harsh cleansers leave my face really red after use this one doesnt do that at all the best , I love how it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean not dry at all nor oily It removes my daily makeup Ordinary serum foundation brow pencil blush just fine If Im wearing mascara and lipstick Ill usually remove those firstif you wear waterproof or heavyduty makeup this might be a good final makeup remove step for you but not the only one I usually do a pass with micellar water on a cotton pad after and sometimes I do get a little bit of foundation it or I missed Its a gentle cleanser that makes my skin feel very nice so I dont mind Love that its unscented too , Decent cleanser not bad but not stellar Doesnt break up makeup particularly easy despite having an oil component Skin doesnt feel stripped after using which is good nor is their any kind of oily residue after rinsing off , An amazing cleanser as a the first step in a cleansing ritual It removed all of my makeup effortlessly and the milkyoily feeling of the cleanser makes it feel luxurious With that being said this has to be used in conjunction with another cleanser afterwards to keep the pores on the face free from black heads Would highly recommend , I was sceptical at first my face didnt feel clean  aka not scrubbed but after using it for a couple of weeks my skin was clear and stayed clear for 2 months until I tried another cleanser Definitely coming back to this one , Love this milky oil cleanser for am use It is great for removing that top layer of oil from sleep off the skin without stripping the moisture I wouldnt recommend it for makeup removal necessarily as it is runny , This is unlike anything I have ever used The milky consistency of this cleanser feels amazing on my skin and really does a wonderful job taking off all my sunscreen and foundation I use this as the last step of my cleansing routine starting with an balm like Cliniques Take the Day Off Balm All you need is 1 pump and it will cover the entire face This bottle will last me at least 5 months making it a great purchase for sure Perfect for my ultra sensitive skin  , I use this to loosen up my makeup before i use my normal cleanser It works very well and can take off my brow filler instantly as well as loosen up stubborn mascaraeyeliner It doesnt work too well for matte foundation but its a good start I like how the pump is optional Putting it on a cotton pad and then applying might work better for some foundations , I use this as my morning cleanser and its perfect for that I love how gentle it is It does not dry out my face nor does it make me breakout I used to use La RochePosay hydrating cleanser but this much better I really love their whole cream skin line  I have happy cream skin , This cleanser feels luxurious I used to struggle a lot with cystichormonal acne and now my skin is mostly balanced I use this cleanser to help maintain my balanced skin it is soothing cleanses enough to prevent breakouts and remove makeup and hydrating so I can use my more drying liquid exfoliants I am on my third bottle I have a fourth under my sink that I just bought because I am worried about it selling out I dont wear heavy makeup or foundation so I cant speak to that but I do wear lots of mascara spf and occasionally concealer blush and eyeshadowliner I use it as a first cleanse at night 23 pumps or in the morning when my skin is dry , Im almost done with my first bottle which i bought impulsively and i am loving it For those saying that this doesnt remove makeup of course it wouldnt You need to double cleanse to erase all the makeup I use banana co cleansing balm and this after It doesnt dry me out I have a normal skin but my 11 yr old daughter is acne prone and im buying one for her too that is how gentle but deep cleanser this one is , Well I expected so much for this product and it was just a waste of money First of all it feels great It doesnt dry up my skinHowever this doesnt remove make up at all How I know this I always use micellar water after the new make up remover product to check if it is really removing make upAfter the use of this cleanser and micellar water I was surprised to see the cotton how dirty it was So much residue of sunscreen and liquid foundation Omg I used decent amount of product and massage quit long time and well Even other makeup remover oil and cream from drugstore which is under 10 doesnt leave this much of make up residueThis quality is I would say close to gentle face gel or milk cleanser  not make up remover Booo So expensive too What on earth , Great for sensitive or combo skin I am very fair and acne prone  Id be lying if I said I never broke out or it kept my break outs at bay but it did not aggravate it either The consistency is just what I needed foaming cleansers tend to dry me out and this is not too oily and super hydrating I dont wear a lot of make up but when I do this seems to do the job if I double cleanse Be careful around the eyes though Only downside is there arent any strong actives in it , This cleanser is great Its super gentle for those with sensitive skin and has the added bonus of easily wiping away most of my eye makeup One star off because I think it has a bit of a funky fragrance but other people dont seem to mind it , I have very dry sensitive skin redness While I think this is a good cleanser I was not overly impressed with it This has a very thin consistency and is quite literally like washing your face with milk I could not feel the benefits of the oil in this and I think the moisturizing qualities were a bit lacking Because this does not foam I had to use more product and went through it pretty quickly I also found that it did not take my makeup off at all One of the main pros for me is that it did not cause any breakouts or irritate my skin I think this would be great for someone with extremely reactive skin that needs the most gentle cleanser there is For the price I expected more and I think there are better options out there , If you have acne try using this cleanser Although it is not specifically for acne a lot of the times cleansing oils help break down impurities something Ive also recently learned and for the people who say that this doesnt do a good job removing makeup you really shouldnt be using ONE cleanser to clean makeup off your skin I love this product Keeps my face hydrated clean and a little goes a long way no need for a lot of pumps each time , This was sadly not moisturizing enough for the dry areas of my skin and somehow made my red spots look more red I also felt like I had to use a lot of it to make my skin feel clean Even then my face did not feel fully clean like it does with other cleansers The one good thing I would say is that its very gentle and not stripping Probably best for people looking for a light gentle cleanser , I was gifted the Laneige Skin Milk Oil Cleanser and I am so happy to receive it This cleanser is very lightweight and moisturizing The item has a light clean scent The product comes with a pump for easy application This product deep cleans and feels so good on the skin I will definitely recommend , Great for dry skin in winter I dont wear makeup so I dont know if this works for that but when it comes to cleansing this is great for my dry winter skin I do keep my routine simple and fragrance free and I didnt realize how much my other cleanser was causing issue until I switched to this I feel more hydrated when I wake up the next day and this is the only change I have done in my routine , So good if you have dry skin Ive been hunting for a facewash that doesnt make my skin tight and flaky after washing and this one hits the mark For a background I have very dry flaky skin After using this I dont have to immediately apply moisturizer as there is no tight feeling on my face Its very milkycreamy and does not have suds if thats what youre looking for but it is an effective cleanser that I use after a cleansing balm and effectively "
Cream Skin Mist,"I have oily skin so only need light moisture at night I do not use any moisturizer during the dayjust vit c and sunscreen I use tretinoin though and this is a life saver At night I wash my face pat dry apply this to it immediately and let it dry into my skin for 30 minutes before applying tretinoin it creates the perfect cushion for my skin eliminating skin irritation all together from the tretinoin I love it and dont believe my tretinoin routine would be possible without it , This is very hydrating for my skin and leaves a glow finish , It seemed to just sit on the skin more than actually hydrate it It did leave a sticky residue as well so not ideal to use during the day I usually love Laneige and the cream skin line of products but this just wasnt it , I wanted to love this because I love the convenience of a mist but it left my skin feeling sticky Im going to try a couple more times right after washing my face to see if that helps , Leaves skin feeling greasy Works great for moisture but within a week I have the most horrible cystic acne breakout of my life Used this with the cream skin toner , When I tell you I have the driest skin on the planet Ive tried everything this is even better than the Tatcha Dewy Mist it leaves skin plump and glassy I LOVE , I had my very first chemical peel and ouch my face was hurting I didnt want to touch my face to put moisturizer on it and found this fabulous spray on moisturizer Its so cooling and lightweight and feels amazing on my face , This mist is a literal dream  the applicator turns it into a really fine mist that spreads fairly evenly and soaks into my skin quickly It doesnt have much of a fragrance but I dont mind I put this on as part of my nighttime skin care routine but also sometimes mist it over my makeup throughout the day if I need a little kick of hydration Highly recommend , No use of it  It gave me pimples and and made of skin worse Not going to buy again , Favorite amazing for a damaged skin barrier and sensitive skin , Love for locking in moisture I use as last step of skincare and also on top of makeup Makes my skin feel great in the winter , gentleclean smell great for dry skin or during winter months when you need a refresher would NOT recommend for oily skin it is a little heavy and adds a lot of shine to the face will definitely repurchase , I have had a very hard time finding a good toner and this is so great I wish it could last a little longer but it is so great and is a big step in my skincare routine , It was overly moisturizing for my oily skin Great for the winter if you live in a dry area It made my face feel bloated I started using it on my legs and arms and it works great , Absolutely LOVING THIS Im very dry and this is my go to , So much hydration Love the packaging The mist feels luxurious and product lasts a long time My favorite to use after cleansing and before serums , makes me feel refreshed instantly use it right after I do my nightly skincare and right in the morning when I wake up Everyone needs this , Nice mist action but this broke me out terribly both times I tried to use it so be aware if you have sensitive skin this product may not be for you , I noticed a difference in a day Ive used it before and over my make up and it works so amazingIve never paid less than 30 and noticed actual results Please never discontinue , This is so nice to have on hand I only use when my face feels dry or after using an exfoliator because my skin isnt a fan of creamy substances too much but it does help lock in moisture when needed , I bought this product because a salesperson recommended it to me because of my dry skin I have sensitive and dry skin with dermatitis Its something that makes me insecure because of the flakiness of my skin and so I usually feel the need to carry around a small container of moisturizer in my bag on the go just in case Since I work with kids I dont really have the opportunity to step away and run to the bathroom to apply more moisturizer When I told this to the salesperson she quickly suggested this because its a product that I can spray and go After using the product for a week I was so impressed My face feels softer than ever and my skin doesnt feel dry and flakey I love the convenience and the fine spritz of the sprayer I can fit it in my fanny pack and it doesnt leak There are too many good things to say about this product If you have dry sensitive skin just buy it and see for yourself , Love this product  have purchased a lot BUT the bottle is so faulty  you end up wasting product It leaks  the nozzle gets clogged where it wont spray a fine mist  youll end up with globs on your face , It frustrates me that this product is expensive because I literally have to have it the one time I ran out was the worst Im lazy and hate using my hands to spread a lotion moisturizer on my face so this product has saved my skin  the mister is great the texture is so milky and hydrating and dries down and I swear makes my skin look smoother and plumper Plus on a hot day its so nice to have a refreshing spritz , I will never understand how this product works all I know is that its super good and I will never stop using , I love this stuff seriously love it I use it all the time Highly recommend , Amazing It does exactly what it says Only thing down fall is how small the bottle is especially once you become obsessed with it , Makes my skin feel very hydrated and doesnt leave my skin oily , The product itself is fine and I like the fine mister but the packaging is terrible I have used it less than a dozen times but I only have 30 of the bottle left Every time I spray it leaks heavily One time it sat on my counterI kid you notand at least half an ounce just dripped out onto my counter The next time I went to use it there was 12 an inch of liquid sitting inside the cap which of course poured out when I opened it No clue how it even happened Very frustrating and Im afraid to purchase again because of how much was wasted , Just got the mist and im really enjoying it Its not sticky at all Very hydrating and skin looks glowy without looking oily , This is the best moisturizing mist I have used It has a milky texture and a nice fine mist spray I like to finish my skincare with this to sandwich the moisture in or use it to freshen up my face when its been a few hours since I moisturized I do have very dry skin and my skin drinks this up and loves it Im a nurse and I love to carry this is my work bag and freshen up with this after wearing a mask for 12 hr shifts , amazing for my dry sensitive skin magic liquid in a bottle , I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community This is my second bottle of the Laneige Cream Skin Mist the second of what I expect to be many bottles I love that the creamintoner formula is in mist form and a fine mist it is making it easy and super convenient to apply as part of my skincare routine after applying my makeup or just throughout the day to infuse my skin with a burst of moisture without making it feel heavy or feeling greasy , This product is really moisturizing A little honestly goes a long way One to two sprays and I feel my skin hydrated The sprays are also light and even too , This product is amazing My skin is so soft and hydrated I use before make up , I bought this in hopes it could replace the discontinued Tarte Ready Set Radiant spray which was able to provide a moisturized feeling to my face when I sprayed it on over makeup I am not a fan of looking moisturized I care about actually feeling moisturized with my too oily yet too dry skin This stuff doesnt really do a comparable job despite having the most similar ingredient list I could find If you just want a dewy look this is probably fine but if you want something to penetrate your makeup to moisturize when your skin gets too dry after youre already done up this isnt really cutting it , LOVE super moisturizing super helpful when i need to get out the door and go this and my sunscreen and Im ready for the day key for glass skin , Perfectly even mister function love the spray and the product It is essential for keeping my skin barrier healthy particularly while using retinol Does dry sticky so I use it at night under my moisturizer but man oh man does it make my skin so HEALTHY and moisturized , Made my face feel sooooo sticky it was gross honestly had a good feeling but it turned out to be wrong deff returning , LOVE this toner It left me feeling so hydrated and soft Pretty decent price point too but Ive used cheaper toners that do the same thing , Game changer  everyone needs this in their purse Perfect for dewy skin , this product is my holy grail i have dry skin and i spray my face every night in the morning i look so dewy , I literally do not know HOW this is not talked about more Hands down far and away the best moisturiser Ive ever tried in my life Under makeup its perfection on its own its magical This stuff has TRANSFORMED my skin over the past few months My ONLY complaint is the spray mechanism it comes with isnt great It sprays out a little heavysplotchy I put mine in a spray bottle I bought on Amazon I genuinely dont think Ill ever purchase a different moisturiser ever again I dont know how anything could ever be better than this , This is the holy grail Im a glass skin gal and this solidifies the look Makes you look dewy and leaves your skin glowing  not oily I am obsessed I usually use it after my skincare but recently tried it after makeup before using the charlotte spray and baby everyone complimented my makeup saying it looked better than before Im using this till the day I die , Im a dry gal And so even with all the moisturizers serums and oils I slather on my face AM and PM I still need a midday refresh to keep my skin looking dewy and my makeup looking seamless Enter this cream skin mist  my skin INSTANTLY feels better and it doesnt disturb my makeup  Its light and hydrating without being too oily or shiny Will be repurchasing until I die or they discontinue , LOVE LOVE LOVE I have very dry skin and this has been so amazing It feels so nourishing on the skin and makes me glow and look more alive , this works absolute WONDERS for those with dry skin like myself its super hydrating and gives your skin this nice radiant glow which i love  highly recommend it especially for those with super dry skin , I am obsessed I used this for 2 things When Im home all day and my skin starts feeling dry in the afternoon this is perfect to give you that feeling like you just apply your morning skincare again And 2 when I do my full face of makeup and go out all day or night I spray this on every 23 hours to revive my makeup and make it look like I just put it on again  It works great even on top the Hula super hold settting spray Love Love this , I didnt realize how thirsty my skin was until I started using more rich products This is AMAZING Like wow my skin feels so supple and hydrated with this Ive only had it for a week now and Im going through it quick because I love it so much , This is great I love face sprays and love that its from Amorepacific Awesome buy , Im on a quest for moisture For hydration For juicy juice A facial mist is great for layering moisture into my skincare routine but also refreshing my dry skin throughout the day This is really doing something here and I love it Ive been on the Tatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Mist for a while and still think its maybe the best for just getting a quick quench over makeup And Glow Recipes Watermelon Hyaluronic Acid SuperFine Mist has a light pleasant scent that invigorates BUT This one Wow Skin stays damp immediately in a after application and takes my moisturizer twice as far If used as a stand alone skin stays slightly tacky in a good way and glowy for several hours I havent tried it over makeup and dont know how something with this kind of a creamy moisturized effect would impact makeup cant imagine it would be GREATguessing it might melt a little But again havent tried so not sure But so far it has done everything Ive asked of it and more for less  than its competitors , Kinda like a setting spray but for your skincare routine Highly moisturizing Very nice after I use my moisturizer or anytime you need some extra moisture Perfect for my dry skin , Idk how long this product has been around but I wish I had discovered it earlier This skin mist has actually transformed my skin in a matter of days I was seriously struggling with dry skina damaged moisture barrier and nothing was repairing it I couldnt find anything moisturizing enough  until I found this I am SO sensitive to new products Its very rare I find any products that my skin likes  I usually break out no matter if they have fragrance or not My skin is simply super sensitive  acneprone But I have been using this twice a day for 5 days now and my skin has COMPLETELY cleared up my redness has reduced and my skin looks plump  hydrated everyday I no longer feel like I have a dry itchy face throughout the day I spray this all over my face let it dry and apply my moisturizer  spf on top and its been a game changer It also looks great under makeup in my opinion If your skin is already consistently moisturized then I could see this stuff being a bit too much  overmoisturizing But if you have dry skina damaged moisture barrier  you need this Esp if you have acne prone skin and struggle to find products that dont make you break out Its formulated for sensitive skin The closest Ive come to finding a product that helps like this one is Krave Beautys great barrier relief  but even that product would help me for a couple days and then Id have to stop using it because it would break me out in little whiteheads everywhere 10000 worth the money I am so happy I found this product , Great price no fragrance very hydrating efficient packaging My sensitive skin did not burn or redden when I used thisHowever it gave me three blemishes after only one day I never breakout except in response to product and this is the only thing new Ive tried Bummer Not for oily folks , I rarely review products but this is the kind of product that I know my dry skinned girls out there need   This spray is so moisturizing you barely need a night cream on top  No smell no breakouts , Hydrating mist that does the job  Nothing really amazing about this product but it works like its supposed to , This stuff works amazing in the winter months It takes a bit to dry and soak into the skin but it leaves your skin feeling soft and supple , I have dry skin and I thoroughly enjoy this product It is hydrating but I dont think it will replace a moisturizer if you have dry skin like myself I use it multiple times throughout the day when my skin is starting to feel tight and parched Its very refreshing when you spray it on your face and doesnt dry down in a weird way , I feel like when I use this with my other creams it reduces redness a lot I use very strong actives and I use Clinique 72hr lipid cream which always makes my skin red but once I layer this before putting on my Tretinoin my skin does not turn red I have combo skin but use this spray atleast twice a day If your skin is peeling from peels or you use strong actives try this , i love this yes its a little overpriced and bc i like it so much ive really been going thru it which concerns me lol But its just so nice and give a my dry skin some extra moisture and glow that is much needed in the winter months i understand this is the same product as the tonermoisturizer but i really dont care i prefer this application so much more as i can use it throughout the day , OKAY but this is Greatttt i use this after my spf for that extra glow i also use it during the day or after makeup i use this after the tonemoisturizer  from laneige amazing hydration SAFE for sensitive and acne prone skin , I literally used it all up Perfect and easy to put in my purse when my face needs some moisture I just bought the cream skin tonermoisturizer one to keep at home for everyday use And the mist to keep in my bag Love how the tea leaf is harvested once every year pretty cool , This mist was everything when my skin was very irritated and just felt like I couldnt hydrate enough Its hydrating but so soothing Let it settle in and relax , This is by far the most moisturizingsoothing facial mist I have tried I also tried the Glow Recipe and Dr Jart sprays and this was definitely more effective for me My face felt soothed and I feel this could actually stand in as a moisturizer for someone with oily skin , I have tried SO MANY face mists this one is the best It actually works I mist my face a few times a day because it helps me feel refreshed and makes my skin look great For reference I have mature skin that tends to be on the dry side I hope Laneige never stops making this , I always said I would bathe in the original cream skin toner if I could afford it Well this is the next best thing I am obsessed with this toner especially for winter My skin is typically super oily but gets drier in the winter I like to get my most moisturizing steps in the toner phase so it doesnt feel too thick on my skin then use a light moisturizer This is the most moisturizing toner I have ever used It feels a little oily but more in a refreshed glowing way than thick oily mess way I have seen some reviews of it breaking people out Personally I have super sensitive skin and it never broke me out so if you are curios to try it I would try it for yourself to see , The mist is really nice and it is hydrating but it gives me little white heads all over The first time i thought it was just a one off and maybe my skin was being a little more finicky or sensitive than usual but Ive given it a few chances now and its happened every time I really wanted to love this product and I was so excited to have something I could quickly mist to relieve my dry skin but its not worth the weird break out it gives me , I wanted to love this product but it broke me out I probably shouldve known this because pretty much all facial mists do for me Might just be my skin type combo , Im on my fifth or sixth bottle of this It never ceases to amaze me how well it works There is literally NO other product that has this kind of ingredient list of high quality ingredients and its fragrance free Also the mister is divine and you can change how much pressure you use to control how strong the spray is which is great It is great for super dry skin and it basically leaves a film of hydration afterwards like I could skip moisturizer and my skin is SO DRY Nothing on the market like this One of a kind , I love it it keeps me feeling hydrated during the day If I know Ill be out longer I spritz this baby on my face , I feel as if Ive tried about 75 of all hydrating sprays on the market and I can honestly say that all but a very small handful do anything but actually dehydrate the skin which makes sense scientifically if the product is waterbased If there is no heavierweight ingredient like an oil all it will do is cause the water in your skin to dissipate into the atmosphere along with the water from the product So youre normally actually LOSING moisture by using a waterbased hydrating sprayThis product has a more unique set of ingredients that includes oil and therefore seals in the water to a certain extent actually hydrating the skin better than any other spray Ive used If you get dry throughout the day and want to rehydrate without destroying your makeup this is honestly the best option Ive found , I love the Laneige Cream Skin Toner  Moisturizer so I was excited to try this I only realized later that it is the same product with the same exact ingredients but in a little spray bottle For a few dollars more you can get the tonermoisturizer bottle and twice as much product 150ml for 33 compared to 75ml for 27 I still love the cream skin toner  moisturizer but this just feels gimmicky and seeing that others mentioned this in their reviews I do wish I had read them more closely , The mist mechanism is awesome you get a nice fine even spritz every time I like the smell I like the feel and I like the instant dewy glow I cant go 5 stars for one reason  when it dries which happens like super quick it feels tacky If you worry about product being sticky in the slightest bit you might not love it , I love this mist I spray this on after I use my hyaluronic acid and it locks it in place so nicely It leaves my skin feeling soft and plump I started receiving compliments on how dewy my skin looks after I started using this Ive had problems in the past with products like this because of the mister but the mister on this is soft and sprays evenly onto my face , I use this as a moisturiser lol Good for humid climates Great , The most beautiful face mist every girl should have  It helps skin in hydration and gives that perfect glowy look Also it has helped improve my pimples so much and I finally feel more comfortable in my skin now , Really nice does exactly as expected I was looking for some soothing moisture or protective barrier for my rosacea prone skin and this is great and leaves me looking dewy , SO hydrating Whether its helping to prep the skin bring more moisture in after doing my makeup using it throughout the day to freshen up  or my favorite using it on days I dont use makeup  THIS IS BEAUTIFUL It makes your skin look soooo healthy , So easy to incorporate into your skincare routine I use this in the AM and PM as well I love how fine the mist is and how it sprays over my face evenly I love the finish of this product not sticky at all and truly feels hydrating I substitute this for toner Dont know if thats okay to do but its been working wonders for me thus far , Holy Grail  This milky spritzer is a staple in my daily routine So moisturizing perfect right before my deep nighttime moisturizers  in between my actives steps , 100 recommend Its gave my skin a boost rand such subtle glow Would recommend , Sprays evenly all over your face You dont need much but it will make your skin glisten It is not sticky and very lightweight I did try spraying it over my makeup and it helped to create a subtle glow It didnt mess up my makeup or anything I think this will be the first Laneige product that I will be continuing to use And I did notice improvements in my skin texture Im pretty sure it is because of this product since I have not made any changes to my skin routine the last two weeks , So many great reviews I wanted to love this I just dont find it does that much I can leave it out of my routine and see no difference Right now Im just using it in an effort to use up the bottle , I love love love Laneiges Cream Skin I have dry skin and so before I reapply sunscreen in the afternoon Ill do a nice coat and feel refreshed This gets a fivestar rating but its more costeffective to just get the Cream Skin put it in a mist bottle of your own , First time reviewer that I can remember Would really love Sephora rep to contact me I use to purchase a Tatcha serum that was discontinued at Sephora This is the replacement 3 stars it is easy to apply and odorless but causes me to break out horribly Please let me know your suggestion to replace Tatcha Radiant deep brightening serum used to be about 80 USD for 17oz , No Leaves a weird greasy film over the skin it dries down feeling like a layer of serum I returned it after 2 days cause I couldnt tolerate that feeling on my face By the time I actually applied my TWO serums and spf i looked like a grease ball and it did not go away for the day This might work if you are on Accutane or its winter time , I use this toner mist after moisturizing and its amazing  It sets your skin for the day with a beautiful glow and amazing moisture , Even though it has the same ingredients as the Cream Skin Toner I like this mist a lot better The mister is very fine and dispenses the product in a much thinner layer than I get with the toner The ingredients here arent super amazing or anything but I think this does a really nice job of hydrating and moisturizing the face If the price were lower I would give the product five stars , I loooooooove the feeling in my face the texture everything Its my holy grail I highly recommend this mist , Works great on my teens son face  He had sensory issues so a cream on the face was not working  This feels like water on the face and hydrates just enough , I got this in a gift set after loving the tonermoisturizer and always dreamed of it as a spraybut as much as the reviews say the formula is the same I cannot agree The most left my skin much tackier than ever with the toner on my hands Also when I used cosrx snail muscin on top of the spray did this daily with the toner it would become milky like it wasnt sinking into the skin Pretty disappointed but I will probably continue to use the spray bottle for the original formula Save your money and just buy a spray bottle , This is basically the same formula as the cream skin tonermoisturizer just different packaging I found that I like this packaging better but I buy the original cream skin tonermoisturizer and transfer it into this spray bottle You get more product in the original than this mist I use this after double cleansing I spray it on a cotton pad and tone my face then go in with active serums and followed by moisturizer This is the order that has worked best for me for the past year I love that it doesnt dry out my skin combination oily This will forever be a staple in my routine , I dont necessarily think this is the second coming of Jesus like the other reviews on here Its not as outstanding as Laneiges cica mask or previous formula of the water bank moisture cream RIP However my skin reacts to a lot of products and seems to like this mist just fine I use it beforeafter exfoliating and its great If I spritz later in the day when my skin is feeling dry the dryness comes back 1 hr later , I absolutely love this product Now that its winter my skin gets extra dry so I use this after applying my moisturizer to add a boost of hydration to my skin and my skin drinks it right up It reminds me a lot of the tatcha dewy skin mist which Ive repurchased multiple times but the price tag is a bit more friendly Def recommend  , I purchased this as an alternative to the tatcha dewy skin mist I must say this is better The reason for the star deduction is because the ingredients are identical to the cream skin toner which bears the question do I really need to go out and buy this product as well as the other product when they are essentially the same product  So what I did was purchase this product strictly for the container because the mist is ultrafine and refill it with the toner since you get way more product with the toner for a couple dollars more , I absolutely love this mist  Its very lightweight but incredibly hydrating and moisturizing so my combo dry skin looks plump healthy and glowy  Its also almost eliminated the surface dehydration I usually deal with during the cold dry NYC winters  I use it during the day and almost like a serum as part of my nighttime routine it layers well and although my skin is ultra sensitive and reactive has never caused any irritation  I cant recommend this enough and think it will work for all skin typesI dont suggest using it as a facial mist over makeup as itll break everything down , Bought this product because I absolutely love the Cream Skin Toner and thought this would be good for a touch of moisture throughout the day I think it does do the job but I feel like a lot of product just dissipates into the air and its such a waste This has been sitting on my dresser and I rarely reach for it for this reason I also find that when I pat it into my skin the consistency is a bit sticky compared to the regular toner My recommendation is to just stick with the original Cream Skin Toner as its more worth it no product wasted , Stick with the toner This mist is not just fine  its ultra ultra ultra x50 fine I dont feel anything I have to wet my skin and hold it super close at an angle to feel like anything is coming on my skin I wont be repurchasing this mist , this is a super light and fine mist it almost feels like nothing is on your skin when you spray it i have found myself blowing through a lot of product very quickly because of this compared to the regular cream skin toner this is much lighter and does NOT leave you with the just moisturized feeling but it is a good product to wet the skin before a serum or lotion i have oily dehydrated skin so i find the original cream skin toner sufficient for a light moisturizer this spray however is too light for that i would almost prefer just a standard facial mist instead of this product especially considering its heafty price point , love this mist I double cleanse twice daily And this mist does the trick to rehydrate my skin , I have dry sensitive skin with redness in my tzone I have been using this as the last step in my skincare routine and it has helped my redness go down immensely It helps give me that extra boost of moisture that my skin needs I dont this this is a necessity for everyone but it could be beneficial for someone that needs added moisture without the weight of a heavy moisturizerserum , Absolutely love this mist It is ultra fine and works as a great hydrating step at any point during my skincare routine It does not disrupt makeup and feels super refreshing without feeling super heavy or oily Definitely a new fave , I had this in a value pack but Im not a very big fan of mists I dont use it often because it makes my skin feels greasy I would never apply it on makeup would be so oily I prefer to put mattifying powder for the middle of the day  , I was gifted the Laneige Cream Skin Mist and I am so glad to be an recepiant This product works great I applied this product to my face after cleansing it This product has a smooth milky"
Retinol Firming Cream Treatment with Peptides + Hyaluronic Acid,"Love it Ive been dabbing in retinol based products here and there but this one has been the best so far No drying out the skin seems like it actually hydrates and plumps Definitely a good buy Recommended , Excited to keep using this product Laneige sleeping mask is one of my favorite products and laneige  is also one of my favorite skin care brands Love a good retinol so Im hoping this gives me great results , this is my first product by this brand Ive tried it out for about seven days now I have noticed smoothing properties from the continuous use I think its too soon to be able to tell if its firming but I do love that it contains retinol for antiaging which I like to use on my forhead and around my eyes it had a interesting package upon first opening but included steps made it easy to understand , I love the packaging for this retinol  It is easy for traveling with and bringing on the go The applicator is easy to use and I love the results on my skin the morning after applying this and wearing it overnight , It is a bit worrying to use retinol from the first try I liked it but it was a bit invasive for my skinIt cant be combined with any other product and it left my skin quite dry I recommend it if you know how to use it , Ive been using the laneige firming cream treatment for two weeks now and Im so excited to keep using it I know results are more apparent after four weeks but I feel like Im already starting to see fewer  less defined fine lines I tend to have dry skin and a lot of products dry me out but this cream surprised me and is doing an amazing job at keeping me hydrated Definitely my favorite retinol based product yet 1010 cant wait to keep using , Ive always been scared to try retinol due to the mixed reviews about the initial reaction that may occur when using the the product Ive been using this for about a week every other nice and my skin is doing well Im 25 and I noticed some fine lines around my moth when I do a lot smiling and the lines are already starting to smooth , If youre looking for a reliable antiaging product that works effectively Laneige Retinol Firming Cream is definitely the way to go I was pleasantly surprised by how well it reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on my face leaving my skin looking noticeably firmer and more youthful The cream is also nongreasy and easy to apply making it a convenient addition to my daily skincare routine I highly recommend Laneige Retinol Firming Cream to anyone looking for a quality skincare product that actually produces visible results , Let me start by saying this packing is 100 unique simply because of the way u have to basi ally unlock it to use it Its pretty cool Now the product t itself I like it but its nothing that blows my mind and makes me want to have it Yes it has firming effects and it doesnt tingle or irritate my skin but it just doesnt have that wow factor It reminds me of ant old retinol  Gifted by laneige , Got this for free to try  this is so so great It makes my skin feel really nice I cant tell any of the firming effects as of now but I feel like with time that will come Ive tried a lot of KBeauty Retinol products  this one is really great So glad to have it in my collection So far this has been a winner , I received this Retinol Firming Cream Treatment to test out and review complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest opinion I like this retinol cream so far I really like the texture of it and the scent I think the tube is pretty small though but still I like the cream a lot , I love this retinol Its so gentle and hydrating and moisturizing and it just feels like a regular cream serum I think from a K beauty standpoint they did a really great job of formulating a retinol thats gentle yet effective , I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest reviewI have some fine lines around my eyes and forehead and I like this cream because it has pure retinol and hyaluronic acid The hyaluronic acid helps minimize the irritation from retinol The cream feels creamy enough and I use a pea size at night and its enough for the fine line area So far so good I look forward to the result using longer usage , I am loving using this cream in my skincare routine  After a few days of using it I could see an improvement in my fine lines  My skin has a much softer and smoother texture  The absorption of this cream into my skin is fast  My skin is more beautiful and hydrated I am loving this cream , Gifted by laneige for an honest review I was really excited to try this but havent seen too many results yet since it hasnt been very long It has a nice texture and applies well onto my skin so I will keep using it , Im enjoying this targeted retinol so much  The applicator is so easy and much more sanitary than a jar  I love that you can control how much product you need as well  I havent been using it for too long yet but on nights I use it I feel like my fine lines have a softer appearance  I cant wait to see my results with continued use  Its a very gentle retinol and has not caused me any redness or irritation either , Ive been using this product for over 2 weeks  now and it does what its suppose to do This does make my skin flaky which is what i look for in a retinol but just remember to always moisturize ur face Although its a but pricey i feel thats its with it and ill probably buy another one when i run out , Loved this new serum gifted by laneige My skin looks so much hydrated and plump the next morning when I use this I only use it once a week as I have sensitive skin for havent had any reaction except smooth skin , I am obsessed with this retinoid I find that it is so effective up without being super harsh on the skin I have very dry and sensitive skin so this is a great addition to my skin care I like to use it at night after I tone and before I moisturize obsessed , This is hands down the best wrinkle product Ive used in years It has single handedly fixed a couple problems I have with fine lines around my eyes and Im sooo thrilled Its super easy to use and you use sooo little of it I think it will last me a long time Totally recommend , I can always use a good retinol but I didnt know Laniege started selling this The Retinol Firming Cream Treatment leaves my skin hydrated without feeling heavy or oily Received complimentary from Laniege , I think this might be my next holy grail Almost overnight I saw a huge difference in my skin My skin felt more hydrated and more supple the fine lines around my mouth also looked blurred The product itself isnt heavy and its super hydrating The packaging is also really nice but thats just a bonus on top of all the other things I really liked about this product , I was very skeptical when I got this product because my skin tends to go a bit crazy with retinol if I am not extremely careful but not with this one Within a week I noticed a difference in my complexion without compromising my skin barrier so I am extremely happy with the results , Started using this in my daily skin care routine and absolutely love it Love the texture of the product and like how it makes my face look I will continue to use it to see if I see a difference as it is too soon to tell , A very good starter retinol option Gentle and hydrating on my dry sensitive skin I started by using it 2x a week and I havent seen any irritation or redness on my skin yet I would say you could use it even more often in the beginning if your skin is more resilient or if you have used other retinol products before , Gifted by laneige I love the retinol treatment I think it works wonderfully I just put a dab on at night and when I wake up I can noticeably see a difference in my skin I am so excited to see final results with further use , I received this complimentary from Laneige and its one of their new product I really want to try I like that it doesnt break me out and I see my skin texture improved Its former smoother and hydrated I also love the beautiful purple color and the sleek packaging , Gifted by Laneige This retinol is powerful Its definitely a start very very slow product I usually dont have sensitivity to retinol products but I was a bit irritated after one use of this so I know its powerful The packaging is a bit weird to me but Im excited to continue using and seeing long term results , I really love firming retinol cream Its super thick and I found it to be gentle on my skin

Love Laneige and this is a very nice beginnerfriendly retinol product The packaging is lovely as usual too  sleek and pretty pastel colors On days that I dont feel like using tretinoin I will use a gentler product like this The texture is very smooth and lightweight and easy to blend into the skin It doesnt feel harsh or drying at all especially paired with the hyaluronic serum Used at night with other products it absorbs into the skin easily and layers with my other products without issue My skin feels moisturized with a slightly firmer and bouncier texture Gifted by Laneige , I received this product for free from the company but I have really liked their other products when I have used them in the past so i am sure that I will like this one as well I love using retinol creams to help with my skin , I see such a big difference in the hydration levels and overall firmness of my skin after just a few uses The packaging was pretty but I did find the top a little difficult to open and ultimately the bottom of my tube broke leaving me to use that instead of the top Otherwise the skincare itself was great but definitely disappointed in the packaging , This is great for textured and dry skin This is perfect for sensitive skin Ive noticed a smoother texture overall and I love that it also contains hyaluronic acid because Im very prone to dry skin and this definitely helps hydrate my skin as well as reducing lines and smoothing out my texture , I thought this retinol serum is quite effective  I put it on in the evening and I noticed less fine lines  I also didnt experience any skin sensitivity  I do wish it was a bit larger but I definitely enjoyed using it  Gifted by Laneige , I got one of these in December and just got second Retinol Firming Cream Treatment from Laneige I like that it quickly absorbs and I can see immediate hydration and it smoothes fine lines and wrinkles It goes a long way so tini size is more than enough Complimentary from Laneige , This product has done wonders for my skin in regards to how it looks and feels Ive actually noticed that my wrinkles dont look as prominent as I have before definitely a smoothing affect which I love , I Used it as it mentioned on it  On face is alright but I got burned around my eye area and it feels itchy dry and redness so definitely its not for eyes I have stopped using after 3 applications So use it with careful , Wow  This cream worked right away I cant beleive how amazing it is My fine lines literally disappeared I will definitely buy another one , This retinol firming cream is great I used it for weeks now and have noticed the fine lines by my eyes are nearly diminished and my eyes look more youthful looking My smile lines are non existent anymore It is a great product , After using this

tryitwithtopbox in exchange of my honest review I have been using this for 3 weeks now I was a little hesitant to use it first as it contains retinol but started using it and followed all the instructions I havent noticed much difference in the fine lines yet but the skin texture is definitely improved It feels more smooth and fresh now I have noticed it has made my skin a little plump up The fragrance is not too overpowering its mild and refreshing Overall I like it and would like to keep using it for the desired results , I received this product for free from TopBox Circle in exchange on an honest reviewIve been using the Laneige Retinol firming cream treatment for about 3 weeks now and i have already noticed a difference in my skin I use this as the last step in my nighttime skincare routine and have been focusing it more on the fine lines near my eyes forehead and laugh lines my skin noticeably looks a lot smoother Im definitely going to continue using this product focusing on my problems areas as so far i am loving the results I would totally recommend this retinol treatment to friends and family and if your someone wanting to start using retinol i think this would be a good starting product freeproduct trywithtopbox , I was sent this product to try out for free in exchange for my honest review Im pretty new to retinol and had no idea what to expect with this but I heard it was formulated to help combat fine lines and wrinkles I have some wrinkles under and around my eyes and around my mouth as well I began using this firming treatment every night before bed A little goes a long way and it has a really mild scent Within two weeks I definitely began to see some improvement in my skins texture and it also really helped with winter dryness I didnt see much of a difference in my wrinkles and mouth lines though I think perhaps I need to use it a bit longer But also when I looked at the ingredient list I was a bit disappointed to see retinol is halfway down the list Perhaps after finishing this tube I might need to gradually work my way up to a higher strength of retinol to see better results I also want to add that this tube looks deceivingly small but will last you ages It is a bit steep at 50 so Im not sure I would repurchase freeproduct trywithtopbox , I received this shampoo from Topbox as a freeproduct Im quite picky when it comes to skincare products  I have combo and acne prone skin with lots of PIHhyperpigmentation and active acne When I tried this out I was worried because I know retinol can be harsh sometimes This product felt very nice and soothing on the skin it is definitely a gentle formula like theyve said  I think thats due to their hydrating ingredients peptides hyaluronic acid It was a good consistency overall not greasy nor drying I did find that it was helping to exfoliate some of my skin off which is what you want from a retinol to help get a youthful glow but I wouldnt say that it would necessarily help with facial lines especially seeing that the retinol is further down on the ingredient list I would also need to give it a longer try to see if it does anything to my smile lines It is also quite expensive for such a small amount  50 for 15mL Overall  it is a nice product and Ill use it until its finished but not sure if I would go out of my way to purchase  especially if youre considering this one for helping to firm your lines and wrinkles Would definitely be good for beginnersyoung adults getting into retinol though , I received this freeproduct from trywithtopbox in exchange of my honest opinion I was so impressed with this product so far I have been using this product at night time for the past 2 weeks and have noticed a difference in the fine lines on my forehead As well my skin looks so much more hydrated and healthy I will continue to use as this has made a huge difference on my skin in such a short time , I got a chance to try this

freeproducts , I received this product freewithtopbox  I have been using this product every night for just over 3 weeks now they recommend to start every other night but I have been using retinols in my routine for some time so I opted for using it every night from the beginning I have started to notice a slight difference in my smile lines but overall havent noticed a huge different with my fine lines The hydration from this product is perfect it absorbs quickly and nicely into my skin without leaving any stickiness or residue behind It has a nice not too strong scent to the product The

noticed my fine lines had decreased and my overall complexion looked more radiant It was easy to add into my nightly skincare routine a few nights a week and application was easy I was glad this product was not so harsh on my skin through following instructions on the box The only negative is the price of this product is outside my budget if I were to purchase and for such a small tube but I am very satisfied with this product trywithtopbox , This new retinol firming cream from Laneige I found to be gentle on my skin I received this product free to test for my honest reviewI liked the

issues with sensitivity to products sometimes and had no issues with this Although Im not sure I see results yet I do know that it take more than 30 days to start seeing any results I really like this and Im going to continue to use itfreeproduct trywithtopbox , I think the is a great introduction to rational as this product seems to contain very little retinol  I started off with a small amount as my skin has had previous bad reactions to retinol products  I didnt noticed any break outs happening so I increased the amount of product used on week 2 of using it  I havent noticed any changes to my fine lines or areas of my face that are starting to lose elasticity but I have only been using the product for 3 weeks and week one I used such a small amount  I do like the scent and feel of the

quite long if using only at problem areas Overall loved the experience and will keep using it The retinol did not irritate my skin even in delicate areas like near the eye , Unlike most retinols this one didnt dry my skin out or irritate it at all Im used to my skin getting a little irritated by retinol but this one has hydrating ingredients It is easily spread onto the skin and you only need a

pretty good retinol freeproduct , I recieved this product free through TryitwithTopbox in exchange for my honest review In the three weeks I have been using this product I only have good things to say

Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence,"Its really good and it lasts forever I have dry and sensitive skin and didnt have any reaction to it its not sticky and dries really fast , the difference ive seen is great it has made my face more brighter and has faded my acne scars very quickly im amazed worth the price , I dont know what sorcery is in this product but in 2 days Ive already seen improvement in my skin My skin is less red more even toned and healthy looking I purchased the vitamin C serum and moisturizer and am so impressed I will definitely continue to use and repurchase , Ive been trying a lot of toners and facial essences the past year So far I like this one the best because it refreshes my skin and it smells great like orange citrus The only thing I dont like is that I cannot remove the plastic pump from the glass bottle so not sure the container can be recycled easily after Im done with it , Must have in my routine It locks in my moisture and keeps my hydrated while also make my feel healthier about my skin and making my skin more radiant , If you arent used to essences the watery texture is a surprise but it works the same as a serum I put it in my hands rather than a pad so I dont lose product to the pad and pat into my face It gives a really nice glow with a only slightly tacky finish which I feel plays nicely with my sunscreen or other actives but it is not oily in the slightest which can be an issue with a lot of vitamin C serums Great for acne prone skin or if you are combining with another active and dont want to get too much weight on your skin Its doing a nice job evening out my complexion and I love the glow without a dewy finish , La premire journe que jai essay cet essence clat jai ador lodeur sublime de fruit dorange de vitamine C  Ma peau est tellement devenue belle et douce aprs cette application  Le soir jai fait la mme chose une application sur mon visage  Il en faut trs peu pour avoir une peau radieuse  hydrater  souhait  Cest un trs bon dbut de routine de soin beaut  Cest tellement agrable dappliquer cette essence fait de produits entirements naturels , Im obsessed with essences and Im obsessed with Laneige products usually This product is way too watery And for the price point Im not sure what its doing for my skin Its even more watery than SKII would , trywithtopbox freesample Love this product from Laneige It helped fade some of my light scarring from acne and did a wonderful job of keeping my skin moist and supple The product didnt feel heavy on my skin The scent was light and not too strong with a hint of citrusorange scent I would recommend this to my friends , I receive this product free in exchange for my honest reviewI am obssessed with laneige products and this one is not an exemptionit has a very light smooth texture that is absorbs by the skin easilyFor 3 weeks of using it definitely helps brightens my face and acne scars are reduce It has very light scent and did not cause irritation at allI will be purchasing this again , I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community AmbassadorThe instructions mention 3 ways to apply the essence sweeping it on like how you would a toner soaking cotton pads or placing in the palm of your hands and patting it into the skin I tried all three and I liked the last method the most since it has vitamin C so I want to ensure it absorbs and sweeping it on doesnt feel like it would provide maximum impact Ive definitely noticed my skin look and feel more hydrated after using this essence recently I think its also lightened an acne mark on my face but will have to continue using to see if it brightens the rest of my face overall I am liking the way my foundation looks lately though which is a good sign about my base The timeline on the side of the bottle is also super handy and innovative since it denotes how long youve been using the product and when you can expect to see results The packaging is great in that respect but the dispenser is just awful The opening is far too wide and I had to knock off a star because its becoming a nuisance I typically use about 2 pumps and clasp my palms together before attempting to pat it in but the essence is quite watery and it sometimes drips down my arm or I have to be careful not to spill it Given how watery the formula is Im not sure why the dispenser opening is so wide as other Laneige serums Ive used dont have this problem Anyway you probably wont have this issue if using the cotton pad method to apply but I thought Id call it out since they mention multiple ways of using it and so should accommodate diverse application methodstrywithtopbox freeproduct , Another amazing product from Laneige After using this product every evening for the past few weeks Im in love with it It has a liquid consistency and absorbs quick It really adds a lot of hydration to my skin especially after consistent use Its also evens out my skin tone and fades dark marks

freeproduct I am so happy I got to try this product thanks to trywithtopbox It is definitly a new member to my skin routine The feeling on the skin is smooth an refreshing I only didnt love the

pilling  It was easy to incorporate Hard to tell if it had any major effect on me though Although its 150ml which seems huge there are notches on the side of the package measuring 30 days A nice touch but that means the recommended amount to apply is quite a bit , I got this from Topboxcirlce Freeproduct to try for my review First the orange packaging and bottle really stands out The texture isnt oily and my face adsorb it well It has a nice scent to it too I used it in the morning and also applied sun cream due to brightening was one of the key thing in this essence , I received this freeproduct via trywithtopbox Im a big laneige fan so was excited to try this new essence I apply it during my morning skincare routine The instructions suggest 23 pumps in the morning and up to 5 at night  I think thats too much 2 pumps were enough to saturate my cotton pad I wonder if they suggest more pump to go through more product and thus need a refill sooner this went on my skin easily absorbed quickly with no irritation I notice my skin is slightly brighter though Ill take a few more weeks of testing it out to say definitively , It was a great experience to use this product My skin is dry and sensitive this product is very hydrating I used it during  daytime and the smell was very orangy but refreshing at the same time Felt nice on skin  and left the skin smooth It fulfill the

felt like a high quality skin care product Upon use I was not disappointed in this product Its very watery and applies nicely to the skin At first it smelt like it would burn on my skin I guess I just had an association with other similar smelling products However there was no burning sensation to be had with this product After several weeks of use I have noticed my skin is brighter and looks better than before freeproduct trywithtopbox , ive been using this product everyday at night since couple weeks feels fresh and clean after using and very easy to use freeproduct trywithtopbox ,

in my skin My skin became more clear and bright I have dry skin so this really helped I use it twice a day morning and at night It doesnt have a strong smell and its not sticky at all I like how it came with a small paper with instructions on it which tells you how many pumps to use for day and night I highly recommend it freeproduct trywithtopbox topbox , I received this freeproduct from TopBox in exchange for my honest reviewI started off using this product strictly in the evenings to ease my skin into the change My first impression was that it smelled amazing Wasnt too strong or perfumey After about 2 weeks I started using in the AM as well It has worked great It absorbs well and doesnt leave my face feeling sticky My skin looks noticeably brighter and my skin tone more even The only thing I did differently was the amount used It suggested 3 pumps in the AM and 5 in the PM which I personally found to be way too much and like it was never absorbing into my skin For me I found 2 works the best but again thats just my skin and the recommended amount could work well for other people All in all I really enjoy this product and will likely be purchasing a replacement when this is empty , I received this product as freeproduct from trywithtopbox I love this product Fragrance is not too strong for me Best part its not very sticky It definitely made my skin brighter  and smoothet , I received this product test for free in exchange for my review from Topbox Circle Ive been using this product as directed for almost a month now and Im very happy with how my skin looks In the morning it feels really nice and refreshing My skin looks looks glowy and refreshed and I think its helped to even out my skin I think its also helped to moisturize my skin and keep it hydrated The bottle appears that its only supposed to last a month as it has day markings on the side of the bottle I used it for 2 week straight and had not hit the 7 day mark even I use one pump of the product which I personally find is a lot of liquid for my face and sometimes it spills out of my hands I prefer to use this product with my hands instead of on a cotton round but maybe with the cotton round it would be the perfect amount dispensed Its a tad expensive but I love the way my skin looks after using this and it seems to last way longer than expected so I would absolutely continue to purchase this , Ive been using this freeproduct from trywithtopbox for 3 weeks and I like it I use it morning and night after cleansing my face The product is light and suits my delicate skin well It gives a feeling of freshness I recommand it , I received this freeproduct to trywithtopbox but Ive tried tons of skincare products before and was pleasantly surprised with how effective it was  I would

serum moisturizer and cleansing steps twice a day and used sunscreen regularly  Actually did brighteneven my skin over 2 weeks of regular use Good value lots of product for the price I feel like I barely made a dent in it and there are lines on the side of the bottle so you know when approximately youre going to run outWhat I knocked points off for Pump is very frustrating too much product comes out at once and its watery so it gets all over I feel like its easy to waste product due to spillage if youre not careful Overall really great addition to a routine  easy to use effective and in

Berries n' Choco Kisses Set,"I can see why everyone raves about the chocolate version Its literally chocolate in a jar its smells so good that I want to eat it Its not the fake kind of chocolate that smells like plastic If someone blindfolded me and put this in my face to smell Id want to eat it I hope they make this in a bigger version but it seems they wont considering its been out every Valentines Day month for the last couple of years , I have always wanted a Language sleeping mask specifically the Berry one While I was walking in the store I found this and was in shock I LOVE

around 9pm and at 730 my lips are still nice and creamy , Smells AMAZING especially the chocolate I needed to use it for several days to notice a difference but it has helped these dry winter lips

absolutely amazing I love it so much , Love these so much I tried the original lip mask when I went to Sephora and I had to buy it It smells so good and is very moisturizing I typically cant find products that are moisturizing but this one definitely is , Love this lip balm but very bad ingredients especially for a lip product I scanned it on Yuka see picture And now I just learned they test in animals  I think I might return it I dont know what to do , I must echo so many others on this page PLEASE make the chocolate in full size and permanent I bought this set to see what all the hype was about and it doesnt disappoint , I use this every night and wake up with soft smooth lips , Il hydrate trs bien et les deux odeurs sentent vraiment bon , I have been using the laneige lip sleeping mask in berry for a few months and it smells delicious i decided to get this set because its adorable ive been using the chocolate one for a few days and it smells soooo good literally feels like im putting chocolate on my lips it does moisturize and stay on pretty well i primarily use it at night i would definitely get this again , I adore this lip mask and the chocolate smells so yummy You get a lot of product in both and Im holding back from buying the gummy bear one because I know this will last forever My lips are a mess without the laneige lip mask , I so wish this product worked for me but I found my lips were peeling so badly after using this product , Love this set Super moisturizing and the chocolate is perfect , It smells sooo good The chocolate one smells just like Nutella to me  , they smell so good and they hydrate my lips so well you can use it as a lip mask or a lip gloss it will last on your lips for a whole hour which is lot longer than most lul masks and glosses , I love these lip masks I use them during the day The Chocolate one smells amazing Keep making new flavors and Ill buy them all , This product is very hydrating for my lips when I put it on but the product does wear off after only a few minutes and doesnt really do much to my lips that much This is basically an expensive chapstick , I bought this product before learning that Laneige tests on animals On top of that both the chocolate and berry masks dried my lips overnight Returned for a refund , Love the chocolate one Its a little less greasy for some reason than the original ones which I appreciate My hubby did say I look like a corpse with it on but its fine Such a lovely scent to have before bed please make a full size , These lip masks are a new favorite of mine I enjoy putting

masks and got this solely for the chocolate mask Omg it smells amazing and leaves an adorable chocolate tint that looks great with my red hair 10 out of 10 , I really love this product Its a super good deal since you get another one but only two dollars more It has helped so much with my dry lips and theyre no longer dry Definitely repurchasing , Literally the best lip mask I have ever had this is definitely worth the money it last forever The chocolate lip mask looks exactly Nutella and smells like chocolate I mix the berry and the chocolate together , Ive been using this lip mask for the past few weeks at night and its really working My lips became so dry with the weather changes but this was one of the only products to actually make a difference Easy to apply with the mini spatula and tastessmells great , I like this product I find that it is moisturizing and keeps my lips hydrated but I will say that I was very disappointed to find out that this brand test on animals  , I was really excited after reading so many reviews here and in my favorite magazine but it was very underwhelming  Its just as good as any lip balm across a spectrum of price points  There was no special effect for me , Ill start off by saying I here the tiktok community say laneige tests on animals so thats why I never tried it Unfortunately this is the best lip product Ive ever tried , I legit wear this mask every night  before I apply my makeup The lip balm goes so well with this mask too It keeps my lips feeling soft  its very gentle , The product should not be called a lip mask I dont think it does anything my lips still dry out What i like about it is the smell and the feeling on lips when i apply Bought it first time will not continue to buy more more Pricy , Laneige Lip Mask is amazing  I wear this instead of neutral lipstick when I go out The chocolate is literally like putting melted milk chocolate on your lips  it weirded me out at first but now Im into it and the brown tint is a nice alternative to brown gloss , The chocolate one makes it well worth the purchase I agree with other reviewers please make chocolate permanent Would love to be able to purchase it separately and full size , I was hoping j could throw this on before i go to bed but i tried and it just dried out my lips But my favorite way to use it is put it on before i do my makeup and take it off once im done and it leaves my lips smooth and soft perfect to aply your lip stick on after also very nice sents , LOVE the chocolate hoping I can find it again in the future , Delicious tasting and a must have I always had dry lips until I used Laneige Now they always look smooth and beautiful , LOVE THIS PRODUCT I will admit it works but it isnt anything crazy special But my lips are very soft and the scent of these is so good Definitely a fan of the chocolate Packaging feels so luxury Great product and good value this will last forever , not nearly as good as the old formula its a bit thinner and doesnt lay on as thick so you have to apply more for it to last through the night And its actually a bit drying I have to wear lip balm underneath the mask so I dont wake up with dry lips , All I have to say is make CHOCOLATE permanent It is the perfect nude for my lips too I have been reordering the Laneige Lip Mask for several years now my two favorites have been Berry and Vanilla Love my lip mask , Love it would so buy it again leave your lips so soft and smells good too lol , I love this so much Really great valentines set and great value , I love love love the laneige lip mask I bought this set for the chocolate specifically I love the smell however it looks a little like 2 smeared on my mouth , its scented overpriced vaseline lol at least it makes me feel rich tho , smells divine and tastes good too Will utterly transform your lips into soft and supple awesomeness , i got this for someone for valentines day and it was a hit so cutesy it only came with one applicator but i kinda wish it came w one for each still was perfect for valentines day , I bought this specifically for the chocolate one even though its small  its sooo good  I hope Laneige hears our requests and makes the chocolate flavor in a original size to purchase separately  the only little complaint id have is it can leave a brown color on your lips and for me personally brown lip products doesnt suit me lol , So yummy and so moisturizing I hope they keep this year round , Love all the Laneige lip masks and lip balms but chocolate has to be my favorite They should make it a permanent option It smells just like Nutella , honestly the berry and chocolate combo are SO good i only bought the set for the chocolate and i was not disappointed please release the chocolate as a full size , tastes so good i havent had chapped lips since i started using it even in the winter my lips are usually soooo chapped during the winter they bleed , I opened this today super excited The packaging is pretty and yummy looking The chocolate smells just like chocolate The berries have no smell at all I was looking forward to it They are very moisturizing though , I was contemplating on getting the original lip mask for months but then I saw this set and IT WAS PERFECT The Laniege berry mask does wonders for my lips and the chocolate mask smells so good , I love this product and the chocolate one smells like  Hersheys , The chocolate one feels so moisturizing and has the perfect nude tint  they need to make a full size  , after having chronically dry lips for YEARS i have finally found something that works these lip masks leave my lips sooo supple and kissable and they stay hydrated after the product soaks in they also smell great and leave close to no tint the only one that leaves behind tint is the chocolate and you cant really even notice it its so sheer 1010 would recommend , Garde mes lvres hydrater tout la nuit  Je ladore il est doux non collant texture trs agrable et il sens trs bon Jai hte dessayer lui au chocolat , Ive been using this product for 2 weeks already and I love it Not only have I noticed a difference in the appearance of my lips but even my mom has told me that my lips look healthier and no longer chapped lol , The chocolate is literally the best one They need to bring it out solo and in a lip balm kz I cant get enough and the slightest tint is perfect , Good value for the amount of product compared to the price of 1 full sized mask The chocolate smells amazing and is the perfect size to just keep in your jacket pocket , Here to second everyone else please release the chocolate as a full size It smells SO good , As all say the chocolate is great not too chocolatey its off putting Lovely tint As everyone wants needs to be sold separately and not limited , As someone with chronic chapped lips I found that after using this product my lips were so soft I definitely recommend this product to those who always have have chapped lips , its cute only bought it for the chocolate one plz release it in a full size , love the creamy sweet feel of both their smells are to die for  , I personally think this set is very worth especially because the Laneige Berries lip mask is practically the same price as this set This is my third laneige lip mask purchase  this product is the absolute best , Laneige I beg you make the chocolate flavor permanent I have several flavors and I love them all but the chocolate one is delish This lip mask is amazing I am addicted , I looove these lip mask It made my lips so soft The chocolate one smells so good and and the berry reminds me of the strawberry duvalin , the chocolate lip mask smells just like nutella and it makes my lips super soft totally would recommend , Didnt do anything for my lips it dried them out and made them peel They smell super good but not for my lips , I love this product so much The berry lip mask is so hydrating and cushiony The spatula makes it so convenient too They smell wonderful I usually dont like fragranced products like this but they smell so wonderful , the chocolate smells super yummy like nutella i love it so much and the classic berry one works well and leaves my lips soft , I own a few of the regular laneige lip sleeping masks but i needed to try the chocolate one so i bought this JUST for that flavor and omg The color is amazing too It was so worth it I hope they make this a full size product , Wow The chocolate is exactly what you hope and expect it would be The color is amazing I hope they make this full sized and permanent Its a dream come true , I usually dont spend this much on lip balm but I read the reviews and thought Chocolate I better try this I tried it and fell in love I hope they make the chocolate a regular stocked item , Berry is same as always super hydrating with sheer color chocolate is really pigmented and equal as hydrating Love them before bed and they smell amazing , Fabulous Love them both The chocolate is fantastic Not annoying but pleasant and a great shade They are both moisturizing and very shiny Love this set , This product is 1000 worth it The chocolate is amazing Not overwhelming at all Also gives a little color to my lips which is nice Seriously hoping Laneige makes it in a full size , Love this product I received the mini sample of the berry lip mask on my birthday last year and loved it I bought this bc I was curious of the chocolate one and turns out its my fav now  def must have product , Smells so yummy And my lips are nice and moisturized all day following use , I bought this set because I love the normal berry flavor and anything with chocolatecocoa flavor is calling my name Although I do like the chocolate flavor and it applies as well as other flavors it leaves a thick brown color that is hard to remove and does not look attractive at all I will keep using at home but would not suggest if your the type that used these in public spacesmareas you will see anyone  leaves a t , This is the only thing that keeps my lips hydrated however the chocolate flavored one doesnt look great with my skin color , Loved the chocolate lip mask Wish it came in the same size as the other one Smells just like hot cocoa Theyre both really hydrating My lips have not chapped since I started using these , Ive never purchased a lip mask before but when i saw this i had to get it Im not sure if lip masks are supposed to feel a little sticky or not but this one does slightly its not an inconvenience or anything because it is alao very hydrating love how they smell as well , I bought this set exclusively for the chocolate scent and while it does smell delicious the product is too pigmented for its intended use It stained my sheets and is not a colour that works for wcomplexion use I bought this set exclusively for the chocolate scent and while it does smell delicious the product is too pigmented for something thats marketed as a sleeping mask It stained my sheets when I wore it to bed and is otherwise not a colour that works with my complexion for daytime wear I would love a full sized jar of this scent in a clear formulation , OMG it is SUCH a good deal Its like getting a normal berry plus a half size chocolate for only 2 more and it all smells amazing , I dont typically have dry lips but I have wanted to try this product for a while It definitely made my lips feel and look so healthy No other product has been this hydrating to my lips I just wish it had more of a scent Overall it is worth the purchase , Strawberrychocolate is my fave combo ever the flavour the colour  everything about it So when i saw this i wanted it real bad Im glad i bought it  the chocolate smells DIVINE like nutella I will say that i have used laneige lip sleeping masks before and i dont find them any more moisturizing than my lip chap i use before bed They dont have a ton of staying power which can be a good thing  makes it very useable during the day it doesnt feel like your lips are uncomfortably coated One thing is the chocolate one is very brown tinted if you are like me and really smear this all around the outer edge of the lips for maximum softness you will look like a 4 year old who just ate a fudgesicle lol , I love this set so much It makes my lips super soft and they smell good , I like the price of this lip mask duo For a few extra bucks you get a mini I enjoy the scent of the chocolate one but not the tint it makes me look washed out Deeper skin tones may enjoy this guy but I wont wear it outside of the house , Received this last week and have been loving the chocolate flavoured one Still works the same way keeping your lips hydrated while also smelling nice and sweet , I dont usually write reviews but the chocolate mask is AMAZING The smell reminds me of chocolate ice cream Its not the superficial chocolatescent things usually have I hope they make this a fullsize , I love this set Both smell so yummy and I def understand the hype These lip masks are amazing , Such a good price considering the full size lip mask is regularly 24 and the chocolate doesnt smell like the gross fake chocolate 1010 recommend definitely worth it , I wish the set would come with a bigger chocolate one Its incredible smells exactly like coco puffs The berry one has never been my favorite but the formula is the same so Ill use it , Really love this product I saw its effects almost overnight and I really love the chocolate 100 would recommend , I love this set I first tried it in the Sephora gift set Its so cute and I love it for my lips at night The chocolate smells amazing like a butterscotch and berry is nice and refreshing I recommend this to anyone looking for a gift for someone or themselves , Honestly smells delicious and to me it tastes chocolately  I love that it comes with a mini applicator  Laneige is my ultimate favourite lip product hands down , I am obsessed with Laneige products  especially the lip masks However the chocolate product in this set is awful and not the regular formula Only giving this 2 stars for the standard berry option , Scent on the berry is very good chocolate is surprisingly good too Comes with an applicator Dont notice such a drastic difference from wearing it but does smooth lips a tad Still a love and repurchase , The packaging is super cute and the product really hydrates my lips and gives a nice moisturizer for my lips and also smells amazing , I really wanted to try it because i thought it was actually going to taste like chocolate but it doesnt it does smell but has no flavor once its on the lips Its alright but i prefer other lip masks that hydrate your lips more , Love this product The chocolate smells just like chocolate You get it for such a good price , Its a perfect gift if ur looking to giveaway D I bought one for myself and my mom she loved it too It came in cute packaging I liked that it didnt have such a strong smell , When I saw this I immediately ordered it  I freaking love their chocolate flavor it is perfect Literally its perfection  it has a brown tint to it which enhances my lip color the scent is cute and   it hydrates your lips for hours I love it  I ordered it for my sister too  , The chocolate is delicious It is not too overpowering but just enough It smells like chocolate cereal  Im obsessed The formula feels the same as usual which is perfect Definitely pick it up , I have previously tried the LANEIGE lip mask and loved it I wasnt due for a new one but saw this set and bought it immediately In my opinion the chocolate scent is the best one theyve made Its incredible smells like hot chocolate and doesnt taste weird or bad either I will say I was not expecting the chocolate to be very tinted but it is Which I dont mind its a pretty light  dare I say  chocolate brown I really hope they make the chocolate on full size I would absolutely recommend this product , Obsessed with the choco one The smell remind me of hot chocolatecocoa I really hope they make individual choco masks and keep it permanent Its my new favourite flavourscent , Although I just opened a new Berry jar I had to buy this set to try the chocolate and its amazing Like a few others have said it smells and very faintly tastes exactly like Swiss Miss hot chocolate  Im not a huge fan of the pale milky brown tint as it looks almost corpse like on my very fair skintone but that just means I only use it at home It seems like all the best flavorsscents are limited edition so get this while its available because unfortunately like my all time favorite Lemon version from holiday 2021 I dont expect Chocolate to be made permanent Pretty much everyone thats buying this has already tried some version before so my review isnt about the berry or the formula just the chocolate Yes it comes with a spatula , My lips just love this stuff I have a mini pot in each purse Im that obsessed My lips never get chapped and stay smooth moisturized and supple The chocolate flavor in this set is really nice It feels like taking a sip of warm milk chocolate I wish the chocolate was the larger in size but the berry one is nice too Please bring back the mango , I really like this product it hydrates my lips just wish they didnt test on animals but smell great , They both smell amazing but the chocolate one is honestly the best It has a pretty noticeable tint and smells just like chocolate frostingYou have to get it rn , Really fixed my chapped lips and an essential part of my night time routine I find it can that I can somewhat use it as a lip balm too which lasts a long time , Jadore les masques pour les lvres de laneige  ils sont hydratant et ils sentent bons  jen ai plusieurs , Addicted Regular use makes the lips so soft and plump The best one in the range is berry flavour and now got another fav flavour choco kisses It smells exactly like ferraro rocher Consistency same as original one , I didnt expect to love this lip mask so much Im extremely impressed with it Tried to find some cheaper alternatives I do find this pricey for what it is but I honestly could tell the difference when I stopped using it Im so glad I found this set The smaller sized chocolate one is actually bigger and contains more product than the birthday gift mini sized so I was pleasantly surprised about that I would continue to rebuy the lip mask , This is such a cute set The scent in my opinion is not that overpowering so it is not annoying or anything Feels nice on the lips  , Its smooth and moisturizing Pretty sheer colors I wish they were fragranced a bit I can slightly smell the chocolate one but zero with the berry I wont repurchase Too expensive when there are masks that are cheaper for , I love this set great deal It leaves my lips hydrated and I like the scents However I wish theyd give a lip applicator tool with the lip sets Other than that I love it , It is such a good deal and I really recommend getting because the normal price for the berry is 24 and this is 26 so it is a really good price , literally he best my lips are so chapped and i put it on once since i got it and they are so smooth , Obsessed with the chocolate lip mask its smells so delicious literarily only buying another because of the chocolate flavor  , Id give this zero stars if I could this is the driest and cracked my lips have ever been in my life after stopping this and  lots osmia lip doctor my lips are finally back to normal , I usually use Aquaphore for my lips I started using laneige lip masks My lips are less plump when I wake up but are much softer The flavours are perfect , This is definitely a steal considering there is a three dollar difference from the full size pink mask and I get the chocolate one which was limited Edition before so I couldnt get it , i have been waiting to get the chocolate lip mask  im so happy they came out with this love the way it smells  and feels also super fast shipping ordered on monday  got it wednesday , Ive been using the berry lip mask since April of last year and it does wonders for chronically chapped lips like mine The chocolate smells delicious and leaves a super cute brown tint My kit came with one applicator , I enjoy my lips feeling hydrated and well taken care of this is perfect would definitely recommend buying the chocolate smells so good and has a nice pigment and the berry one is just as goodwill buy again , Saw this chocolate flavour in full size in a Romanian Sephora in November and fell in love but never picked up because the exchange rate to CAD would have made it 10 more than back home  Was so disappointed  Snatched this up as soon as I saw in on Canadian Sephora  The chocolate size is actually decent for the smaller size bigger than the holiday set with 5 small ones  I really hope they make full size in North America soon  It gives a nice little colour as well unlike their other flavours , Great value We all love the original but They need to make the chocolate in full size Please , Nice set theres alot of product which is great Great price But the chocolate didnt have much of a smell A little disappointed because I got it for the chocolate Other than that the sizes and the product itself are nice , super pretty and smells so good I love laneige their lip masks are really hydrating and the chocolate one smells SOOOO good It smells like a Hersheys milk chocolate bar and the color reminds me of the glossier swiss miss balm I was really hoping it would come with an applicator which it did , Nice very Very Nice Really Like like like it , Smelling this is like opening a fresh jar of Nutella Im so tempted to eat it For those wondering it only comes with one free application wand The chocolate is also strongly pigmented brown , I just got this set in the mail today and its so great the chocolate smells like Nutella and it comes with an applicator which is definitely an added bonus totally recommend , I love the set however already have a berry from the pumpkin spice and peppermint set from the previous holiday I wish chocolate was offered on its own so its a lovely fragrance and leaves a nude brown tint on your lips  , The chocolate is exactly Swiss Miss Hot C"

design makes it easier to open than round jars It also comes with a product scoop so that you wont contaminate the product with your fingers I like how this immediately made my skin more hydrated and plump It immediately sinks into the skin without leaving behind any weird residue or stickiness and is perfect for layering over other the other oils serums or creams in your routine My one con is the added fragrance definitely not a fan of it I prefer products with natural scents or that are unscented because artificial fragrances can be really harsh on the skin and they are generally unnecessary no one ever has complimented me because they liked the way my face smells , This moisturizer is amazing It is so nourishing and makes my face feel so good after swimming in the pool Sometimes my face feels dry after being in the sun all day and this moisturizer helps me feel so moisturized , So I had already tried a sample of this before so I knew I had to get a bigger one this product is like

and leaves my skin feeling so soft and with a dewy glow It is not greasy at all and is going to be so perfect for a summer moisturizer , In the past I had tried the cream version of this and found for my skin type it wasnt perfect just as Im more combinationoily so it pulled with matte makeup primers This gel version is so perfect for my skin Works well with my makeup products and my skin feels moisturized but not greasy I think the other version is better suited for combination to dry skin , I wear it at night and for me its moisturizing Im 37 so keeping my skin hydrated and supple is the goal for me I do have sensitive skin and I personally like that it does work well with my sensitive skin , One of my favourite moisturizers of all time even after the repackaging I love the look of the container as well as the formulation of the product I have combination skin and it is one of the only moisturizers that effectively moisturize my drier cheeks while causing no ccongrstion in my tzone I would highly recommend this although it is a bit pricey , I usually use the cream moisturizer and bought this by accident The packaging looks exactly the same except for a tiny colored dot they should change the colors of the whole package to make it clear I tried it anyway and felt like the gel moisturizer is much less absorbent than the cream so I dont feel like it moisturizes properly , Changed their formula and packaging maybe two years ago New formula feels light but not moisturizing like its just sitting on my faceAnd the new container is awful It suctions together and you lose product , This is my absolute favorite moisturizer for the daytime Having combooily skin a gel moisturizer is what works best and this is my new holy grail Zero fragrance texture is lovely looks like there are cute little blue beads in the gel but you do not feel them at all when applying I originally received this as a sample and have since purchased two full sized products and plan on purchasing many more , Cannot be good for sensitive skin if it has fragrance in it Disappointed in the amount of brands and their products that claim to be safe for sensitive skin and still have perfumes in the ingredients list , I found this to work well during the hot summer months compared to the cold Canadian winter months Theres much better Korean moisturizers that cost half the price and preform better  , After using this product Ive noticed my face has been less dry Its very moisturizing , After using this firming cream over the last couple weeks I can honestly say Im so impressed with this product My skin looks so hydrated and feels so smooth It absorbs well into my skin and wears great under my makeup all day long , I use this with the serum during the day Its refreshing and lightweight I have dry sensitive skin and it keeps me hydrating all day , I have very dry sensitive skin and this works great for me Most things pill on my skin and this is always smooth and hydrating Great to layer under sunscreen or over serums , I received a few of these as a sample to figure out which moisturizer would be the best on my wedding day I like this but Im not a fan of watery moisturizers Its nice for nighttime but definitely not day time under makeup , I have combination skin and this was the best moisturizer Ive ever used hands down  , I received a sample when I bought the Laneige Lip Mask I feel in love immediately It literally feels like water and you can feel the instant hydration I personally like the packaging It feels cool to me This product is perfect for ooily skin , This moisturizer is fine just fine light plumping without weighing down my skin but not worth the price HOWEVER I would never purchase this again SIMPLY FOR THE LID Horrible product design its so hard to close , Not as good as the one it replaced  on the hunt for a new gel moisturizer , No Opened the jar peeled back the film and immediately closed it Had no clue Laneige changed the formula as I was still finishing up the Hyaluronic Cream and was excited to try the gel I had the old formula in one of the value sets and couldnt wait to get a full jarugh Why change the original formula Laneige Marketing read the reviews I hate when companies create a problem for themselves and then solve it with a new product The hydro gel was PERFECT Please go back to that ASAP , This was awful and I love this brand It was very sticky and thick Then on top of that they took my 500 points when I return it , This used to be my holy grail moisturizer I come back and they changed everything The packaging the formulaoh dear the formula Why It was perfect before Now its awful Never mind , Why mess up something good  this new formula is not good , I was looking to find a moisturizer that would keep me looking hydrated and not greasy This moisturizer is perfect for my skin having oily skin The only downside is it doesnt have SPF so i always just put some on after It makes me look very hydrated even when i have makeup on , I used to love the old formula but this one is better for my combo skin In my late 20s Ive suddenly got more dryness in my skin and its been hard to find a moisturizer that hydrated withou making me oily This is the one Its really light and absorbs so easily but its the ONLY gel in this price range Ive used that doesnt leave my skin feeling tight The beads melt away super easily and I dont get very oily after It also layers well under makeup and it doesnt trigger my sensitive skinThe old formula was heavily fragranced and I found sat on top of the skin This is better in every way , please bring back the old formula I had JUST found Laneige and fallen in love with their line and then they changed this daily moisturizer This one leaves a sticky residue while the last one was the best moisturizer Id ever found , The older formula was much better This is sticky and caused me to breakout Now Im on the hunt for another gel moisturizer , I loved the old HydroGel but then they changed the formula to this It leaves a sticky residue and makes me break out Please change it back , Loving this product so far The consistency is slightly thicker than the older version Feels very luxurious on the skin It imparts a slight coolness and the smell is slightly minty which is perfect for summer , Pure bliss Love the little beads I highly recommend this product , Awful This used to be the only thing that would moisturize my dry skin without making my acne flare up Now theyve changed it and it doesnt work at all What a waste of money  Change it back , Older version of this product was 10x better Please bring back the older version It was PERFECT for comboskin , i LOVE this this is a perfect moisturizer for the summertime it fees lightweight and cooling somehow it absorbs right into the skin with out leaving any sort of film or greasiness the texture is so interesting but it feels great when it applies to your skin would definitely recommend the gel for anyone who is looking for something that wont be thick , i love laneige products and decided to try this the texture is smooth like aloe vera and the formula is cooling and lightweight it brings a lot of moisture to my skin and always makes me have a glow without feeling greasy i havent seen anything bad from this product as ive recently been using it , Thank you to the Sephora worker that recommended me this So amazing I have combination skin I only need a small amount and my skin isnt oily during the day summer and hydrated at the same time I like to keep it in the fridge if feels so nice Im inlove Never changing my moisturizer , With the old formula I used to wake up with supple soft skin When I tried using this newer formula I was deeply disappointed My face felt so dry when I woke up I miss the old formulaIve switched to something else , I got this because I was using the old one and I loved it I have oily skin and it was perfect Its been around 16 days since I bought it and I have been using it twice a day this is not like the old one this makes my face look oily and feel sticky and heavy my pores are clogged and look huge why did they change it I was so happy I had finally found a moisturizer gel for my skin type I will return this and start looking for another one  , Ive been using this for about 34 weeks and its amazing Ive noticed a big difference in my skin and how hydrate its gotten Its reduced my redness and hydrated so much less breakouts and leaves the skin hydrated with a nice dewy look to it , This product caused horrible break out on my face and neck , I used the OG version of this product RELIGIOUSLY as it is lightweight hydrating without being heavy for oilycombo skin and does not irritate my sensitive skin So like everyone else who loves this product I was shocked to see that it had been reformulated Cautiously I decided to give the new formula a try and I was NOT disappointed I love this formula way more than the original It does everything the old formula does but better in my opinion The ONLY con I agree with is that it does leave an odd film after applying feels tacky almost but this goes away after a few minutes If you have dry skin I do not think this would be hydrating enough This is definitely best for oily skin as it is a waterbased gel moisturizer , I am very disappointed in this product I absolutely loved the old gel cream it was a great normalcombination skin moisturizer and it smelled amazing This product is such a downgrade in every aspect Im upset about it I really hope Laneige brings back the gel cream they discontinued because this new one is not it , I really do NOT like this new formula I loved the old formula so much I hope that with all of this negative feedback they change it back to the original This feels horrible and not as hydrating as the one before , Made my face breakout horribly I thought because of the gel texture it would be best for my acne prone skin well it made it worse , i had been using the old formula of this moisturizer and it was absolutely my favourite and i am a little disappointed with the new formula its okay and it wouldnt consider it bad as i like the sort of cooling effect it has but is nowhere similar to the old formula laneige plz sell BOTH , it is greasy and sticky not recommended for oily skin , On day 3 still giving it the benefit of the doubt because I loved the old formula but Im really considering of returning it Its way too sticky and doesnt really dry down Also it almost seems its turning my skin darker Please please bring the old one back ASAP This one is no bueno , I was using the previous version of the Water Bank Cream which was a silky and luxurious moisturizer that provided perfect hydration without making my oily skin feel like an oil slick I decided to try this new gel version thinking it would somehow work the same for my oily skin What a disappointment It really doesnt do much of anything and certainly doesnt provide enough hydration I just dont understand why brands change their formulations so often because in most cases the newer formulas pale in comparison to the better performing older formulas , Really dont like this at all Its not moisturizing and has clumps of beads in it The packaging is cute but bulky I have about half of it left and Im debating if I want to continue using it or if I should just declutter and go back to a tried and true gel moisturizer  belif , HATE HATE HATE the new formula Its sticky and just overall horrible I returned it right away after the first use I LOVE LANEIGE AND LOVED the old formula My skin THRIVED on that formula I had repurchased this item like 67 times please please bring back the old formula , Only reason I gave this two stars was because its still cool on my skin when I put it on Otherwise the reformulation on this is NOT IT Its broken my skin out horribly Please bring back the old formula , I use to use the previous formula but since they came out with the new one I cant use it at all does not help my skin at all and does not work at all under makeup My makeup would not stick to my skin at all and was splotchy Every time I used this I had to redo my makeup until I realized this moisturizer was the culprit , I was willing to give this a try since I normally love anything laneige and even got my husband to use and love their products But to say that I was devastated by how different this was from the old formula which was an incredible god send would be an understatement This is not nearly as moisturizing and is overall immensely lackluster for the price tag Def skip this and keep your fingers and toes crossed that Laneige brings back the original water bank hydro gel cause this is NOT IT Not moisturizing Not a good texture Not good packaging I mean come on why would you make something harder to open Truly any other drugstore brand would probably be better than this , Not a slay Please bring back the old formulalook because the new one is a completely different product and is absolutely terrible I miss the original everyday , feels very fresh smells good works well on my skin , After few days of application my skin broke out big time Acne is back on all sides of face thanks to the new formulation Laneige really decreased the quality of packaging as well as the quality of the cream I used to use this in the morning and the water bank moisturizer at night I have been a consistent customer for the last twotwo and a half years , Awful product Left my skin feeling tacky and gave me dry patches around my nose , Love this product makes my skin feel amazing Definitely will be repurchasing , Very gentle moisturizer I have been enjoying applying in the morning before makeup and it gives a beautiful base that is super lovely The fragrance is great so ni complaints with that I might repurchase again in a smaller size Gifted by Laneige , Nothing compared to the original water bank cream I was so excited to try the new la neige moisturizer as it has been my holy grail for my dry dull and acne prone skin for the past couple of years however I am greatly disappointed I have applied it about 45x only twice a day for 23 days and my face feels super dry and have been experiencing never before seen texture and breakouts I miss the old water bank cream Plus there is a lingering smell So if you are sensitive to smell like I am be aware Disappointed and sad that I have to restart my search for the perfect moisturizer , I loved the texture and feel of this cream BUT I feel like its more for ppl with oily or extremely oily skin I have combo skin leaning more toward the dry side and this made my mouth area very dry and flaky which never happens to me So yea I would go with the cream version of this if you have normaldry skin maybe even combo like mine Ive exchanged for the cream version but have yet to try it , I got to trywithtopbox freeproduct Its a nice light moisturizer Probably not moisturizing enough for drier skin I enjoyed the light fragrance and the packaging is lovely it leaves the skin hydrated and ready for your primermakeup , I really like laneige But this new formula has made my face really dry and chapped Now I have to find a new face moisturizer , Typically love laneige products and LIVE for the cream water bank but this product triggered the worst perioral dermatitis flare up I have ever had , I felt hydrating results after using this complimentary from Laneige moisturizer for two weeks I do feel like it does absorb quickly on my skin which makes it feel smooth and soft The packaging is so nicely put the design of the bottle makes it super easy to open and the mini scooper is perfect , Wow quel bon produit la neige tryproductjai reu cette crme en chantillons gratuits de topbox Jai utilis la crme depuis quelques jours et jaime vraiment sa leffet hydrater est super et rend ma peau trs douce et soyeuse  Elle sent tres bon aussi et sapplique bien Je vous le recommande , I received this complimentary from Laneige I really like this gel moisturizer My skin feels very hydrated after use and I like the consistency as its thicker than other gel moisturizers Ive used in the past I do think that it takes a little too long to absorb and felt slightly tacky after absorption but Im loving the results and will continue to use , I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review This moisturizer provides a good amount of hydration to my combooily skin Ive used several different water gels and this is definitely one of the more hydrating I like that the gel is slightly thicker than most and can be built up on my dryer areas although a little does go a long way My main issue with this product is that its quite sticky and leaves a residue that remains on my skin for at least an hour after applying Id compare the texture to aloe vera gel Despite the stickiness it layers well with other products and I havent had problems with it pilling Im also very acne prone and it hasnt caused additional breakouts like many products do I typically prefer fragrancefree skincare but I dont mind the scent of this one Its light and pleasant and hasnt irritated my skin so far I like that the product comes with a small spatula so it doesnt become contaminated or get under my nails when I scoop it out I do wish there was some kind of holder in the container for the spatula though especially since the top corners are rounded and anything stacked on top may slide off Overall this was a good moisturizer but due to my issues with the texture Im not sure I would repurchase it at full price , Since I got this product I have been amazed by it The packaging is super cute and I wasnt expecting the product to come with a beauty blender which is fantastic too The product has become my favorite foundation ever Now my face looks like silk how it says in the name of the product excellent 100 recommended I really love it Gifted by Yensa , I was pleasantly surprised to with the Laneige Water Bank Gel Moisturizer Not only did it leave my skin feeling hydrated and soft but it didnt leave a sticky film on my skin which Ive come to expect with gel moisturizers It didnt add any additional oily shine to my skin after wearing it all day long which is another plus I also really love how it comes with an applicator to avoid excess contamination from using your fingers in the little pot I think I might actually repurchase this one I received this product complimentary from Laneige , This was gifted to me by Laneige It has a very mild scent in my opinion Absorbed lovely and wasnt sticky at all Left my skin feeling moisturized and bright The packaging is simple and cute Loved this product and will purchase again , This is my first time trying Laniege brand and wow This moisturizer is very hydrating and penetrates in my skin I can see myself glowing and not dull like it used to The packaging is so cute as well I received this complimentary from Laneige , Go to moisturizer for the summer I have combination skin and during the summer I always try to use a gel like moisturizer so it is not heavy and with all the sweating my face doesnt look greasy And this is just perfect It feels like a punch of fresh water In love I received this complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review , Im a big fan of Laneige products and this one did not disappoint I have oilycombo skin and this moisturizer hasnt caused a breakout which is nice The texture is thick but absorbs quickly and nicely into the skin This cream does have a slight fresh scent but is fairly light and diminishes during application The packaging is a baby blue container you turn the top half way and pull up to lift the top off which is different from wanting to unscrew the top like other packagings Using this moisturizer for weeks has hydrated my skin and less dull It even works under makeup without separating If youre looking into a hydrating moisturizer that melts into your skin and works great alone or under makeup then this is the one , I received this Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review This is a very nice lightweight gel moisturizer that feels very cooling and soothing on my skin  It comes in a cute blue jar with  a convenient little spatula to help apply the product  It absorbs fairly quickly instantly hydrating my skin leaving it feeling soft and smooth  It has a nice delicate scent and the formula doesnt feel sticky or heavy  Its also helped my combination skin to look and feel hydrated yet oilfree , Im very surprised at how much is loving this gel moisturizer I have combo skin and with the weather changing this product ended up doing a great job at moisturizing enough for both days and also being used as a night cream It sinks in well and doesnt leave a heavy tacky feeling thats noticeable The only gripe I have is with the design of the jar I noticed that it twist to open but doesnt twist all the way off It twists about halfway and then you have to pull up on lid to completely remove it I struggle every now and then because I forget it doesnt twist all the way off which is different from other products but does take an extra few seconds to remove I did receive this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my review This did not sway my opinion but I am very thankful for the opportunity to try this moisturizer , I received this product complimentary from Laneige for my honest review and trial I feel that my face is moisturized and refreshed after use My skin absorbed this quickly without a greasy residue after The packaging was cute , I was very excited to receive this product that was gifted by Laneige for my honest review I had heard good things about it and was hoping it would live up to the hype The first thing I learned with this product was that a little goes a long way The product was instantly hydrating As someone with dry skin this product moisturized my skin and helped it to stay moisturized throughout the day without making me look oily I used this moisturizer as a base when applying makeup many times and it left my skin hydrated and blended with my makeup very nicely After application my face felt very soft and smooth The only thing I would say negatively is that although this product is recommended for oily skin it just makes them look even more oily and did not go away through out the day Aside from that love the product and would definitely recommend , This was a really good moisturizer It has a light smell but didnt irritate my skin  It did a great job at maintaining natural moisture while not feeling oily and didnt  to clog my pores which would cause a breakout I really liked it personally And Im a sucker for the cute packaging , This moisturizer was gifted by Laneige This was a really awesome moisturizer It has a light smell but does a good job at maintaining natural moisture It was not oily and did not seem to clog my pores I really liked it personally The packaging was also adorable , Complimentary from Laneige Im a huge fan of gel moisturizers and was so  excited to be able to try this Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel moisturizer The first time I put it on I instantly loved the white almost mircrobeads in the gel and how they melted in my skin so fast The gel its self has a very light scent and felt like aloe Vera when applied minus the sticky feeling It left my skin feeling very moisturized which was amazing The next day and every day since Ive used it I keep breaking out I know normally things make you break out on the first few uses but its been two weeks now It should have been okay by now but its not and I cant keep using it It really saddens me it just wasnt for my skin after"
Hydro UV Defense Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50+,"This is pretty good I was looking for an SPF that did not leave a residueoily sheen It is better than supergoop products but still prefer the old shisheido liquid spf , Love this sunscreen it has a very calming effect on my skin and one of the few chemical sunscreens that doesnt make my face inflamed great for my dry skin will definitely repurchase , I have very sensitive skin and I LOVE this product slight scent and leaves me skin dewy without being sticky , Very moisturizing and does not leave a white cast but it is VERY fragranced Do not recommend if you have oily or sensitive skin , Really wanted to love this since it left a glowy finish on my skin This is one of those sunscreens that makes its way into your eyes as the day goes on Burns and made my eyes red Not only that but if you get this near your lipsmouth at all you can taste it in the back of your mouth ALL DAY Tried it a couple of times with different application but the end result was always the same , This is great for dry skin on dry environments If you have slightly oily skin you would hate this product cause it literally feels like a Nivea cream but if you are on the dry team youll love it , BAD It pills smells really strong and cause breakouts Dont buy this if youre oily skin and acne prone Leaves a sheen look and I look oily , Im one of those people who just do skincare in the morning and nothing else so I cannot speak to how this works with makeup However I really do not like this product I let all my serums and moisturizer set in before I put this on as my last step This product is very stickytacky I feel like I cant touch my face all day because this just wont dry down I spend all day excited to wash my face to get this stuff off  I do not recommend this product , I know that sunscreen is an absolute must I do but I have hated every sunscreen I have ever used For YEARS I have searched for a good sunscreen one that was light weight but effective and didnt make my oily acne prone skin upset after 2 hours Well I have found my holy grail This sunscreen is amazing It is thicker than I would normally like admittedly but that is OK because it does not FEEL overwhelming It feels amazing and I feel protected A definite MUST HAVE , Itd be good for dry skin but since I have oily skin this just made me super oily It also irritated my eyes sometimes It has no white cast at all though which is nice , LOVEEE this sunscreen gives me a glow and it looks perfect under make up it doesnt have a white cast at all or it doesnt peel either it is amazing and very worth it , I love this sunscreen I put it on last sometimes it leaves my skin slightly oily but the trick is to get a paper towel toilet paper or even a cotton pad and dab the shiny areas It wont take the product off , We all know we should be wearing sunscreen on our face to prevent sun damage but most of us dont My struggle with sunscreen has been the white cast is leaves and that SPF smell you know the smell Laneige is the first facial sunscreen that I have found that doesnt leave a cast and smells nice It is very lightly scented and once applied to the face I cant smell it at all It starts off a bit greasy but absorbs into the skin and wears well under makeup , After searching trying  buying numerous facial SPFs over the course of decades drug store through to the ridiculously expensive I believe Laneige Hydro UV Defense is NEARLY perfection for me Its only drawback that I have fins is that it does cause some temporary burning when soloed near the eyes It Kays for a short time  eventually clears up , Leaves your face pretty oily Also irritates the eyes Maybe Im just sensitive but the skin around my eyes gets really red , Ive been trying to find the best sunscreen to use under makeup and by itself I have combination and sensitive skin so I have to be careful with the products I put on my face This hydrates the skin without making it greasy Doesnt disturb the foundation and smells very clean , I really love this as a hydrating sunscreen so far I love centella as an ingredient in their Cica Sleeping Mask especially while using Tretinoin so I wanted to try this sunscreen because of it It has a slight scent and when it goes on it looks a bit greasy but after it sinks in for a few minutes it leaves a really nice hydrated look , I personally love this product because I have very dry dehydrated skin  This makes my skin look and feel lightweight and luminous at the same time  I would definitely recommend this product for dry skin that isnt super sensitive and even if you have normal skin type and you are looking for that clean gorgeous glow this is it I also love how hydrating this is it is like a moisturizing sunscreen If you are scared to be to glowy then you could definitely try skipping your daily moisturizer in the morning and just go in with this at the end of your skincare routine I wouldnt say that this sunscreen is heavy I think it is very liteweight and long lasting with no white cast which I loveThe sunscreen does have a little fragrance but honestly it doesnt bother me I have sensitive skin and sense none of my other products have fragrance this just adds a elegant floral smell I wouldnt  recommend this product for super sensitive skin that gets irritated by using fragrance but if you dont mind it and you want a sunscreen that is lightweight and makes your skin have a beautiful bright glow then this is definitely the product for you   I understand that people with more OilyCombo skin type would not enjoy this sunscreen because of how oily the product could be with OilyCombo skin I am definitely repurchasing this product I also am very interested in purchasing more products from this brand because I have Heard really good reviews Also I loveeeeeee the packaging , This is the only spf 50 sunscreen Ive found that is noncomedogenic and I actually want to wear every day  Not greasy  doesnt break me out  Also lasts a long time , I have tried so many sunscreens and this one is the best at such high spf It doesnt leave white cast doesnt peel and wears great under the skin , AMAZING I have tried so many different sunscreens I live in Texas and this is the only one that 1 doesnt break me out 2 doesnt leave a white cast 3 that I can wear under my makeup everyday and it doesnt pill 4 has a high enough spf where I dont get burnt I have combination skin but oily in the Tzone and it doesnt make me feel too oily and moistures , I would love this SPF if it didnt burn my eyes almost every time I wear it Even though I have oily skin Ive noticed that a lot of sunscreens tend to dry me out This feels amazing on the skin but somehow its irritating me eyes even if I dont put it near them I like it enough to use it and get my moneys worth but I definitely wont repurchase , I love how this SPF feels on the skin it goes on white but blends in so well theres a light scent but its a nice comforting scent when it gets close to my eyes my eyes do water but besides that I will be buying this again and again , I have very oily skin and this is the only sunscreen Ive found that doesnt leave me greasy and make me breakout Goes on smooth doesnt pill and no white cast , Its very moisturizing but pretty sticky and greasy and doesnt dry down its not good under makeup breaks it up and burns your eyes really bad , Heavier than most body sunscreens with a strong sunscreen scent , This brand is becoming my favorite brand I swear Its so soft and gentle on the skin without all the harsh chemicals and fragrances It keeps your skin hydrated glowing and healthy Once I heard about this sunscreen I just knew I had to get it It doesnt leave you with white cast or super greasy but  you can put it on under your makeup and it keeps you protected from that hot sun This is perfect for all skin types and you only need a small amount too , Would rate it a 0 if I could I used this product for a day at the beach and reapplied multiple times and I burned the worst I ever have on my face I thought maybe it was the sun being too strong so I tried it again next time still burned even though I applied multiple times Everywhere else where I used a different sunscreen did not burn Not quite sure whats up with this but it definitely doesnt feel like spf 50 , This sunscreen is okay I just dont like that if you put it around your eyes it burns or if youre sweating I prefer the super goop one it doesnt do that to me  Over all I love Laneige products just the sunscreen is not for me , This feels like a moisturizer going on which is really nice in my opinion  I think the scent is very mild and my skin didnt sting at all putting this on  I would recommend not putting it to close to your eyes or on your eyelids  Once you begin to sweat your eyes will sting just like any other sunscreen  You will have a slightly oily or slick feel to your skin but my makeup sat well on top of it , Went to a lake in Utah for the 4th of July weekend and it was a scorching 105 degrees both days I was there I forgot to put sunscreen on my face and by the end of the first day I was sunburnt from being at the lake all day My whole face was red and it was painful I kept reapplying this sunscreen and it felt so soothing It did sting my eyes a bit and felt greasy but it did a great job at avoiding me being more sunburnt the second day I have very sensitive acne prone skin and I had no issue If this worked amazing on burning itching cracked sunburnt skin its an A for me , Probably the only sunscreen Ive used that doesnt leave you with a white cast I have a very deep skin tone so its hard to find sunscreen that actually works and looks good on my skin People always claim no white cast on sunscreens and Im often disappointed but this one really does not leave a cast It also leaves you with a really nice glow in my opinion , It looks flawless but if burns your eyes the moment you start to sweat I think this is great for fall and winter But not summer Im debating if I should return or just use in cold weather , i expected this to either be waterproof or lightweight since its called hydro uv defense it isnt it more of a heavy moisturizer Its hard to use for my combooily acne prone skin during the summer im excited to try it in winter thought , This is way to greasy and stays tacky feeling I tried this so many ways and couldnt get it to work for me I usually look for a moisturizing sunscreen Forget wearing liquid foundation over it even matte long wearing formulas look so oily in three hours There are better formulas of sunscreen out there La Roche Toleriane 30 spf is way better regret buying this Will probably use this on my body which is a shame , Pretty mediocre If it has been soothing for some it def has not been for me I knew I was taking a gamble on a chemical sunscreen My marker is alwaysdoes it sting when it shouldnt And this does Esp if its anywhere near my eyes No white cast sure but thats pretty easy to find these days Also doesnt offer much in the way of extras ie doubles as a decent primer Id rather an spf product offer something in the way of improving my skin in addition to protecting it Not just me enduring it I will keep it up for a few days and check in with the rest of my routine but so far Blah , Only sunscreen Ive tried so far that doesnt peel off Also my forehead gets pretty greasy but this sunscreen doesnt add much additional grease I get sun burned easily but since Ive started to wear this daily I havent gotten burned since I have acne but this sunscreen helps reduce my reddening and hasnt caused any break outs , THE BEST Ive tried so many sunscreens and nothing has ever felt as good as this If you have dry skin this is a must Its super moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple It doesnt leave a white cast either I have a medium tan complexion which Im normally always so afraid of when it comes to buying a new sunscreen I cannot recommend this enough , its good and feels nice no whitecast too however it does get pretty greasy and i have to wear powder with my makeup over top of it i would recommend if you have dry skin , Beautiful hydrating sunscreen Leaves no white cast Works AMAZINGLY as a makeup primer for my dry skin , Fair oily acneprone skin here I live in humid sunny coastal Florida I cannot even look at most SPFs without breaking out Dont even get me started on physical sunscreenI have been wearing this daily for two months and I am hooked Not only have I not broken out but my skin also looks better than before I started I have been getting compliments on how clear and glowy it is for me thats huuuuugeI use this as my AM moisturizer  makeup primer going on right over my vitamin C serum If you have normaloily skin you will not need additional moisture Cannot speak for drier skin types The finish is definitely glowy on me so there are times I use a little more powder to knock down the shine But its not a dealbreaker because it helps my makeup melt into my skin and dry down to a lovely natural finish And as for actually protecting from sunburns etc it works I cannot believe how many times Ive been burned after being outside 15 minutes with a fresh face of 3070 sunscreens I have a lot more confidence this one will help with antiaging because I dont get burned with it on , I love that its lightweight and smells good You also only need a small amount to do your whole face Great investment , Its a nice light weight sunscreen It doesnt have the sunscreen smell and it doesnt leave a white cast at all However be careful when applying too close to the eyes because it stings a bit if you apply too close  But over all its a good sunscreen And I have acne prone skin and it did not break me out when I first started using it  , A fellow Sephora employee recommended this to me and I absolutely love this sunscreen I have acne proneslightly dry skin especially the chin area and this sunscreen feels amazing on my skin Its hydrating not greasy and leaves absolutely no white cast Im in my late 30s and now Im recommending to all my friends , I really like this sunscreen I used to use Purito back in 2020 before the scandal then I switched over to Supergoop Unseen which I still adore and I tried Supergoop Play but Play was way too greasy for me This one still has a bit of dew to it but not nearly as bad as Play this one just makes your skin look healthy not like a greaseball Its a cream that blends into the skin seamlessly and I also personally love the scent but if you are sensitive to scents definitely test before buying If youre looking for a new sunscreen to try out I highly recommend giving this one a chance , This protected me while I was out in the full sun planting I really love this because its not thick and it doesnt leave your face white Goes on very smooth I use this after my moisturizer and before my primer , Im not sure if its the Centella Asiatica but my skin looks great by the end of the day when I wash this off I have sensitive acneprone skin and this doesnt bother my skin despite the fragrance I usually dont like fragrance in my SPFskincare but this products fragrance is quite nice and enjoyable No white cast and wears well under makeup Knocked off one star because this isnt watersweat resistant its the only drawback , I have SUPER sensitiveoily and acne prone skin and this product completely helped me get my oil in check I usually struggle to find a good sun screen that doesnt leave me oily but this one helped me tone it down so much Best sunscreen Ive ever tried and its so lightweight , Awesome product 5 star easy to blend very hydrating and glowy finish No white cast , Loving this sunscreen I have dry skin and have been using this instead of moisturizer Its very hydrating but doesnt leave me greasy or white cast  just glowy I put this to the test on vacation in the strong Arizona sun  did not burn at all and was able to reapply throughout the day after hikingsweating and it layered very nicely and never felt heavy or greasy I also used it under makeup using the fenty eaze drop for foundation and had no issues with pilling at all It does have a slight scentbut Im yet to find a sunscreen that doesnt Definitely will repurchase , This product is very beautiful It has a very rich texture that it can also work as a moisturizer I dont put moisturizer anymore when I use this given that I dont skimp on my sunscreen This has zero white cast and leaves my skin glowy and wellprotected from the sun I just wish this has 4 pluses like a lot of chemical sunscreens from S Korea Im just nitpicking on this area so it has something to improve on Lol Other than that try this Also if you have oily skin you might wanna use this only for cold months , I love this sunscreen it goes well with my skin doesnt leave a white cast and isnt sticky  oily like some of the sunscreens So far so goos think i can use this instead of the more expensive lancome brand , I have dry to normal skin Ive been looking for a sunscreen that doesnt leave me oily and also that doesnt get into my eyes I use to go to target and buy sunbum That brand literally made my eyes itch and irritated So I found this guy It has no smell and it did not burn or get into my eyes the only good thing What it did was just made my face so oily and I have noticed my pores opening up more After trying it for 12 days I had to return it Once I applied it again after 2 hours it just made my face worse I was too shiny and oily , Pros  no white blends seamlessly Cons very very heavily scented and lingers on your face for a while I can taste the essence of the sunscreenIf heavily scented products lingering on your face and taste buds is not an issue then this is the product for you , I like this a lot for a no makeup day I wouldnt put this sunscreen under makeup , I was really excited to try this because I love laneige products but this is not the sunscreen I wanted it to bePros It is SPF 50 and does not leave a white cast on skin The packaging is niceCons It leaves a greasy film on your face and feels heavy on the skin If any of it moves throughout the day it gets in your eyes and stings There are better asian sunscreens on the market that do not cause these issues , Ive always thought that laneige products were for people with dry skin I have super oily skin and this sunscreen did not make my face oily at all it also did not leave a white cast It goes on so smoothly too maybe I should be checking put other laneige products , Tried many sunscreens but this one just has to top the other ones I dont plan on switching it at all love how it looks with or without makeup , Great for colder weather if you have combooily skin This is slightly on the heavier side NO PILLING and NO WHITE CAST I truly enjoy this sunscreen , First day using it and so far Im impressed I use the mac studio fix foundation and it did not separate my makeup just a tiny bit but it doesnt bug me It leaves a healthy glow after 7 hours which I like  I definitely recommend if you have combo skin Leaves the skin feeling hydrated Going to to use it again tomorrow just to be sure , I like the texture its creamy and light for a US sunscreen However it does make my eyes sting a bit after I have been wearing it a while Chemical sunscreens tend to do this but I was hoping this one didnt , After a picture in which I looked gray thanks to my old SPF I went out searching for something that wouldnt leave a cast and I found Laneiges Hydro UV Defense Its creamy and it doesnt make me look like I died and no one told me As a darkskinned Black person its hard to find a good SPF but this is it , By far my favorite sunscreen I have mediumtan combo skin with olive undertones and this disappears beautifully following cleansing and toning with zero white cast At times I forget to moisturize on top of it and nothing slides off of it all day Even with moisturizer it does not make my face oily which is a godsend Many users have commented on the scent but quite honestly I think it smells fresh and quite lovely and not at all like the typical sunscreen smell The scent disappears within a few minutes for better or for worse though Couldnt recommend enough , great for sensitive dry skin only downside is the scent is very strong , Please go buy this ESPECIALLY if youre a makeup wearer looking to incorporate a sunscreen into your base No white cast No left over gunk It literally feels like a moisturizer Ive even been able to layer a primer on top of it without the sunscreen peeling apart , Im utterly blown away by this stuff I have oily skin and I had a feeling my previous SPF was contributing to my oiliness throughout the day as the days I wore it my skin was extra oily but I knew my skin was also over producing oil cause my skin just gets so dry in the winter When I discovered this stuff it changed my SPF game for life I think Its super hydrating easy to rub into skin and leaves no white cast at all and the SPF strength is just what I need Im super fair and burn incredibly easily I cannot recommend this enough Seriously Give it tryyour skin will thank you , absolutely the best sunscreen ive used doesnt leave my skin feeling stickyoilygreasy at the end of my morning routine and goes on smoothly without any white cast , Loved this sunscreen I have quite oily skin and I live on a tropical island in the Caribbean which is extremely humid and extremely sunny As I write this the humidity is at 70 and the UV index is at 10 This sunscreen absorbed super quickly into my skin left no white cast Has a faint floral scent when first applied but quickly goes away It does leave a slight sunscreen scent for a little bit but goes away I was apprehensive because of my oily skin but my skin felt perfect and nongreasy all day Cant recommend enough , I have really dry skin so this SPF works as a moisturizer as well It makes my skin very glowy and its not that greasy compared to other SPFs on the market I wouldnt recommend for people who are on the combination or oily side , Found it to be quite heavy and slickgreasy on the skin at first It did absorb into my skin eventually but I didnt enjoy the way it felt I returned it , Not a fan  Unfortunately this formula is no different than any other American spf formula  It causes eyes to sting  its super greasy looking and it just doesnt feel good  Those are all complete opposite is a real original Korean spf , I would give it a zero if I could  And I love the Cica sleeping mask from Laniege  It was super duper fragrant and oily  I have dry dry skin , i wanted to like it SO SO bad but its so greasy  , I love this sunscreen A must for people with dry skin it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth I use this as a primer under my makeup I like the floral smell but for people sensitive to smellit might be overwhelming for them Ill definitely repurchase , This would be the perfect sunscreen if it wasnt for the fragrance Its super moisturizing but doesnt feel greasy and blends nicely But the scent is soooo strong and it didnt fade It smelled like I actually sprayed perfume on my face , I really wanted to like this considering the fact that its expensive and I cannot find any other sunscreen that wont break me out and this one seemed promising It smells like straight up perfume and it was very greasy to the point of uncomfortableness This resulted in breakouts This is the first product I want to return or give away because I am pretty disappointed , Very lightweight and I dont mind the scent I use it daily and have not broken out which is surprising to me since other sunscreens usually cause me to There were a couple ingredients that the yuka app noted to be bad for you but I am sure its very minimal I would most likely buy again , Purchased wmy own moneyI was so excited to try this because Im a huge fan of the Laneige Lip products  the claims sounded like my dream SPF Pros It is very lightweight it adds a nice slight glow to dry skin It wears well all day  looks great under makeup It plays well with other products No pilling It really is a beautiful product  I loved the packaging Cons It is pretty heavily fragranced imo It wasnt terrible on days around the house but I wore it when I had to wear a mask all day I incorrectly assumed the scent would dissipate unfortunately that was not the case It was so bad that I tried washing it off when I got to my destination makeup  all but I couldnt get the scent off my face It ended up giving me a wicked headache which rarely happens to me Conclusion If not for the fragrance this would be my perfect SPF Im so disappointed that brands STILL put fragrance in sunscreen skincare  makeup products Its such a shame but I had to return this I need an SPF that I can wear every day However if you arent sensitive to fragrance you might really love this Especially if you have fine lines mature skin andor dry skin I really hope they release a fragrance free version of this , I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador  I have been using this product ever since I got it and love the way it looks and feels on my skin I have drycombo sensitive skin This product has no white cast when applied and wears well alone or under makeup It also doesnt make my face feel dry or break me out The only drawback Is that it has a slight perfume smell to it but doesnt have the sunscreen smell that other sunscreens have  This is a definite repurchase for me , It really lives up to the claims about not not leaving a white cast and it is truly moisturizing for my dry skin The ONLY problem with it and the reason its not 5 stars is that when I apply it around my eyes it starts to sting and make them water , Perfect No pilling Moisturizing but light and not greasy Best Ive ever had , Love it Feels lightweight makes you skin soft On top of that it does not leave white coat 1010 a little goes a long way , Feels really good on my skin Not greasy sinks in quickly doesnt leave white cast and didnt break me out It does sting my eyes a bit though , I wont repurchase It leaves a shiny layer on my skin and I dont like it I will use up the bottle but not repurchase it , no white cast at all and is so moisturizing i liked how dewy it makes my skin feel and also love that it is spf 50definitely will repurchase , I bought this with my own money since I didnt trust the reviews when they got this product for free There was no white cast which was great but its definitely strongly scented Overall it felt heavy on my skin so I didnt enjoy that You could still feel product on your face even after it settled down Its not the most sophisticated texture so Ill be returning , Very mild scent no breakouts or irritation and this works well under all my foundations but it makes my skin a little dry by end of day  I will continue to use as I want the spf 50 , I love this sunscreen so much It doesnt leave a white cast its fragrance free and most importantly it does not irritate my super sensitive skin I apply it every morning as Instructed by my dermatologist , I was gifted by laneige for my honest review  I really really liked this sunscreen   It smells nice  like like a face cream   it doesnt smell like sunblock It is a thick cream  very hydrating It doesnt leave any white cast  and my makeup goes on quite well after using it  , I got this SPF complimentary from Laneige to test and really like it This cream has pretty thick texture so I need to work a bit to spread it evenly but theres no white cast or any greasiness Its completely invisible on the skin and feels lightweight and hydrating I also love that theres Centella extract in it to sooth skin and the scent is very light , gifted by laneige I really enjoy this product Not the best under heavy makeup but I usually dont wear much face makeup so it doesnt effect me I recommend this product yet it is quite expensive  , I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review Living in Florida means I need to wear an spf every day to keep my skin safe This is one of my favorites It blends in easily and doesnt cause any irritation , Have been wearing this sunscreen for a few days now and i have been loving it the texture is thick but nothing that bothers me tto much the scent is light that is a plus also it makes my skin feel hydrated complimentary from Laneige , Wow I am loving this sunscreen Laneige has never failed when making their products for what they stand for and Im astonished by this sunscreen It feels so light weight with no white cast which is a big hit or miss for me when it comes to sun screens I will definitely be making another purchase  , I have been wearing the sunscreen for a week straight 6 out of days under my makeup The texture is thick and the sunscreen feels a little sticky like primer It has a fragrance that I feel luxury skincare has very light I make sure to lather on a lot of sunscreen and compared to other brands Ive used it is very hydrating Since I have combo skin it definitely can make my makeup look a little oily if I dont use powders or use other hydrating products , Really like it Really good The texture is very liquid and it doesnt give any allergies to my sensitive skin It tones out good and dont leave white cast which I like really most  Definitely recommend gifted by Laneige , I was so excited to try this sunscreen and I have to say its better than I thought  The texture of this sunscreen is lightweight and I loved that when I applied it it was quickly absorbed into the skin without leaving white cast I leave my skin hydrated for a long time and it looks great even with makeup Complimentary from Laneige , I cant imagine my life without a good SPF and this one from Laneige is amazing I love its texture it feels creamy and nourishing on the skin but not heavy at all I also love that it absorbs in seconds and doesntleave any white cast Isnt it amazing I think someone with combo or oily skin can use it on its own I have dry skin and prefer to use this sunsc"
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Eye Cream,"I like this product the texture is light and hydrating I dont think it has a scent Im not sure about the depuffing aspect since I tried a sample that I got with my Sephora order I think its similar to The Inkey List Caffeine Eye Cream but its more expensive  , I am a serial eye cream tester This is the area of my face that needs the most attention and help its where I get rashes have eczema breakouts and am most sensitive so Im ALWAYS on the hunt for the next best thing This is a repurchase for me and has been in my top two favourites for a while It goes on very smooth with a gel like texture that is still extremely hydrating My favourite part is the cooling feeling it leaves on your eyes afterwards that doesnt irritate them The only time I dont reach for this is if Im having an eczema breakout While it isnt the cause of a breakout it certainly doesnt help me through one and this is when I switch to something like a SkinFix or a Eucerin Otherwise this is great for morning and night the rest of the time , Been using this cream for a week only so cant really say I have seen any improvements like brightening effects However I do love the texture of this cream and my eyes will really hydrated I also find it gentle on the eyes A little pricey but given the quantity I think its a good bargain I definitely recommend this if your looking for hydration and something nonirritating to the eyes , This is a nice light cream if you only need hydration and depuffing However I have hereditary dark circles and this didnt help them much It made my circles look blue which made my concealer look grayish  I like Laneige products Unfortunately this didnt work for me I should have returned it , i tried this in a travel size laneige kit and fell in love i am normally not one to spend a lot on eye creams but this one is worth it it keeps you so moisturized all day and is the perfect prep for your concealer  the face moisturizer is just as good , I got this eye cream in a smaller version so I was only using it for about two weeks It has great texture and feels really nice on your eyes buuuuuut I didnt notice any difference but I understand it was quite a short time so there might be some differences later But also its a bit expensive I mean you can find good creams for less money , I wanted to LOVE this product but with my extra sensitive skin it unfortunately broke me out pretty bad The formula is nice but I think my skin is just too sensitive for it Stay clear if you have extra sensitive skin like Mr , I am normally skeptical of eye creams but I have honestly noticed a HUGE DIFFERENCE in the puffiness under my eyes My husband even noticed Ladies as you know this is HUGE  men never notice ANYTHING , This eye cream is so amazing so hydrating  it doesnt burn your eyes  I have been using it for a month now and m definitely gonna restock this  , Im pretty Impressed with this product so far I just have to give it some more time but for the most part its a nice eye cream Its light wakes up my under eye and I look more awake It also layers nice with makeup which is a huge plus for me , Really light and gentle eye cream I have really sensitive eyes and I find this cream really great A little goes a looong way with this product so it lasts a long time , First use and after I developed a rash onaround my eye I have very sensitive skin but its so uncomfortable  , If I could leave 10 stars I would  this eye cream instantly depuffs under the eyes a little goes along way Its a rich formula that has a light scent I love this eye and Im super impressed  , Loving this product so far Light weight and doesnt cake under makeup but still very moisturizing Leaves the skin around your eyes feeling amazing , Wasnt a fan of the reformulated waterbank moisturizer however the eye cream is much better , Laneige is easily one of my favourite skincare brands as their products are effective yet gentle on my sensitive and dry skin This water bank blue hyaluronic eye cream has done wonders for my skin and area around my eyes I have been using it daily and I have noticed results At 36 I am getting fine lines and wrinkles and this wonderful cream has smoothed those lines and helped with the puffiness I sometimes get under my eyes The skin around my eyes also appears brighter now I like the subtle gentle scent it has and how a little bit goes a long way It also cools the skin which feels nice after sunshiny days I have my new favourite eye cream and would highly recommend it if you are looking for something to help brighten smooth and hydrate the skin surrounding your eyes I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review , I received this freeproduct from topbox for my honest review  My first time trying an eye cream and i loved it Moisturizing reduced fine lines smooth texture and very light smell , I like that the application of the eye cream goes on really smoothly does not leave a sticky feeling and is transparent when it dries A little product goes a long way so youll definitely get a lot of use out of the product After incorporating the eye cream to my skincare routine for a few weeks I found that it does brighten my under eyes but does not provide amazing results for the puffiness under my eyes freeproduct trywithtopbox , Great eye cream I love the texture and it helps reduce the appearance of fine lines freeproduct trywithtopbox , I got this freeproduct from trywithtopbox This eye cream works like a magic on fine lines I am using it from one month and my fine lines are completely gone , I received this product from trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review As someone who is new to eye creams I found this product to be extremely user friendly I usually suffer from dry flaky skin around my eyes and eye lids and has never found a proper moisturizer that would do the trick until this one One night of application gave me really hydrated skin around the eyes and the dry skin flakes were no longer seen I also use this product as a primer around the eyes and I dont experience any pilling from the product which is great I also noticed that the skin around my eyes was a lot brighter after continuous use for two weeks I also love that it comes with a spatula so that you can easily apply the product in a sanitary way though I wish the product has a compartment to store the spatula Overall this eye cream is amazing very moisturizing and is light and easy to use It feels weightless around the eyes and is great as an overnight treatment or for daily use , Got this freeproduct from trywithtopbox I absolutely love this eye cream and this will be my go to from now on The packaging is very nice and sleek and you get a lot of product that will last you awhile It has an amazing scent that is not overpowering It keeps the undereye moisturized and makes it look brighter I definitely recommend this product if youre looking for an eye cream that does exactly what it claims , I received this as a freeproduct from trywithtopbox I have been using this product for two weeks in the morning and as well as at night It has a nice send to it Although it is lightweight on the eyes The only thing I have noticed about it is that It has reduced my puffiness but it has not brightened my under eyes , Received this product from top box for free and here are my thoughts This cream was so hydrating Made the under eyes feel so refreshed weighing seconds of putting it on and also helped brighten my eyes I like to put it on at night and then wake up with the brightest eyes No more chronic eyebags for me  , Super cute packaging love the satisfying click closureA little goes a long way Its a medium texture applies nicely and sinks in quicklyThere is a light scent its clean and fresh but not noticeable after application I have fairly sensitive eyes but have had no issues with this This is so hydrating it actually lasts all day and my under eyes have never looked so smooth I have very creasy under eyes but from day 1 Ive noticed an improvement and its only getting better My makeup application looks much nicer I havent noticed much of a change in brightness but I do thinks its improving the longer I use itOverall really love this eye cream Definitely recommend , Got this freeproduct from trywithtopbox Initially the packaging looks big and a bit bulky for an eye cream but thats mainly due to the lid It is cute I like the light scent and way it applies My undereyes def look well hydrated and helps with dryness and fine lines I like this product overall and this laneige line , I received this product free freeproduct from trywithtopbox in exchange of my honest review I am using this from last 2 weeks and honestly felt difference to puffiness of my eyes Its fragrance free which is good The only thing which I feel should be improved is the absorption capacity It takes a lot of time to absorb and you have to be very careful that it doesnt go into eyes I got a little bit of it into eyes as it did not absorbed well , This eye cream is deeply hydrating but still lightweight It wears well underneath makeup and does not appear cakey or crease my undereye concealer I applied this eye cream morning and evening along with the rest of my skincare routine I have sensitive skin this was not irritating and worked well with my other skincare products Overall my under eyes appear brighter less puffy and extremely hydrated , This Hyaluronic eye cream is excellent The consistency is between a gel and cream and immediately upon application I feel my skin become plump and hydrated  It helps diminish the look of my under eye bags and is a nice primer as well  The scent is nice and light and

very happy with this product trywithtopbox , One word HYDRATING I was gifted this to review from Topbox and this is hands down the most moisturizing and hydrating eye creme that Ive used to date If you have dryer under eyes or just dryer skin in general this product is for you This product definitely has fragrancing which is something to note In terms of results that Ive seen throughout the nights that I have used this I havent noted too much of a difference from when I started I will continue using this eye creme freeproduct trywithtopbox , This product has been absolutely amazing for me Around my eye area is typically very dry and peeling but once I started using this product it has 100 honestly refreshed the area and cured all the peeling and dry spots It is super hydrating and a little really does go a long way I truly could not recommend this purchase enough so worth the money , I got this product as a gift from Topbox I mostly use this eye cream at night so far It has a

eye cream Super smooth and general on the skin Not only is the packaging super cute and comes with an applicator but this eye cream reduces puffiness under eyes no more waking up with puffy eyes , I was fortunate to receive this freeproduct from trywithtoobox and Ive been using it for close to 2 weeks It comes with a little wooden spoon which makes it wonderful if you find dipping your finger in the cream unsanitary I love the subtle fragrance as it isnt overpowering to my moisturizer I do find that a little goes a long was as it is super hydrating , I was lucky enough to receive this freeproduct through trywithtopbox and I am so grateful for this experience I have been a huge fan of the laniege line of products for years because their products never disappoint And this was another winner The smell was very subtle and the product left my eyes feeling rejuvenated and refreshed The packaging was also really beautiful Overall this product met the high quality standards I have come to associate with laniege I would definitely recommend , I received this freeproduct with trywithtopbox I need to agree this does what it says I usually use it at the night The first day I used it 90 of my puffiness was gone then I continued for the next 2 days since then my eyes have been looking so bright and fresh I would definitely recommend this to the people i know  , I recieved the laneige

Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Hydration Set,"Hydrating and I love the packaging The samples are also wonderful , Wont ever buy this again The cream smell really weird I dont know if its pass date or something I use to love the old version , I love these products Bought the minis first then bought the full size ones and I love how soft an healthy my skin looks , Worth it bc its more pricey without the package I loved the moisturizer and the serum Im gonna purchase those two again nothing wrong with the rest I just dont use eye serum often and Idk much on toner , De peur de gcher si jamais ma peau complique naime pas les produit jai opt pour ce coffret Javais dj la crme que jaime normment et aprs avoir essay le reste de la gamme je suis conquise et vais commander le reste des produits sans hsit car vraiment trs hydratant et respectueux , Not really sure why this would be recommended for someone with sensitive skin the floral scent is easy too much and the moisture cream doesnt do anything  I was hopeful but another wasted purchase , Do you have dry sensitive skin and want a moisturizer that is going to keep you hydrated for an entire day without making your skin look greasy and feeling sticky Than this is the moisturizer for you , I got this for christmas from my sister I finished the serum and eye cream The eye cream was sold out at my local sephora so I repurchased this set Absolutely love how hydrating this has been for dry winters , Im going to keep using in case it gets better The water cream is quite oily The eye cream is doesnt absorb at all Im using a super tiny bit too The others are not bad Im going back to using Este Lauder , Love this The serum is very thic makes me feel like Im using fat water by Rihanna also the eye cream with hyaluronic acid is so good for those who have dry eye corners when make up is applied , Best set So good that I bought 2 more to stock up Its so hard to find skincare that actually keeps my eczemaprone very dry sensitive skin happy but this does the trick When Im in a time crunch I just apply the serum and cream and it keeps my face moisturized all day , finding this line has been such a gamechanger for me Ive tried so hard over the years to find a skin care line that doesnt break me out or cause my eczema to flare up and this is everything Ive ever wanted I use the like rejuvenating or whatever version of the toner that is more gentle and it is the perfect balance of cleaning my skin without hurting it I hope they never stop making this line , idk what some of the people are saying but theres no fragrance someone said they couldnt sleep bc it was so strong So not true I have the worst sensitive skin and all 4 of these products are insanely amazing , Absolutely obsessed with the hydration these products give If you need products to completely increase the hydration in your face these are the ones for you , Rosacea and sensitive skin here and this product has been a game changer I use The Ordinary azelaic acid to clear up breakouts and then this cream keeps my moisture barrier intact which minimizes redness  I dont think they designed it for that reason but my skin gets so dry in the winter and just absolutely loves this stuff  I swear it also makes my fine lines look less noticeable , I got this as a Christmas present and I thought to try it out As soon as I opened it I can smell the strong fragrance Why do you have to put so much perfume inside for a face cream I wish I can return it All the items are overpowered with fragrance I cant even sleep at night from how strong the smell is , I bought this set a few weeks ago and I love the results so much that Im definitely going to be getting the full size version of the serum toner and eye cream This set came with all the samples as well as a full size cream for only 6 more than the full size cream costs on its own Really gentle and nourishing skin care  great for dry winter skin My skin feels hydrated to the touch I would recommend to friends and for sure purchase again , Je nai jamais eut la peau autant belle quavec ces produits jadore  , If you are someone like whose skin is super sensitive then this is for you My skin reacts to everything and anything its so annoying I have tried so many hyaluronic acidwater based moisturizers and this is the only one that hasnt flared up my rosacea I was a fan of the neutrogena moisturizer and cleanser but after it flared up my skin due to change in ingredients and poor customer service I switched to laneige I do not mind the smell it smells like fresh laundry to me and I use all 4 products at night and only the moisturizer during the day its been  about 4 or so months now and my skin is doing great , I have really dry skin so I thought this product would have been perfect but it has ruined my skin I have never had bad acne and Im on month 3 of a horrible break out that just wont end , Love this product especially Water bank moisturizer I use this every single day and my skin became healthier , My sister loves it The Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Hydration Set is a collection of skincare products enriched with hyaluronic acid to deeply hydrate and nourish the skin The set includes a Water Bank Gel Cream Water Bank Serum and Water Bank Eye Gel Customers have praised the set for its ability to moisturize and plump the skin leaving it feeling soft and smooth Some users have also reported an improvement in the appearance of fine lines and a more radiant complexion after using the set Overall the Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Hydration Set appears to be a popular choice among customers and an effective option for those seeking a hydrating skincare routine , The moisturizer smells a little like glue and it didnt absorb well into my skin felt like there was a sticky film on my face after applying the next morning I could still feel the film when I washed it off my face Dont recommend this especially not for the price , This is the first time Ive used Laneige I have really sensitive dry skin This has been a great so far My skin feels super soft and hydrated after using it for the past two weeks , Each time I get this the cream is never fully full in the container There is so much missing and for the price of this it should be full to the brim Will be trying to find another alternative in the mean time However I do love this product it is the only thing that actually works for my skin Like I said though the price for half of that container to be full is simply a scam in my eyes , I bought this after loving their vitamin c cream The samples are very genius and lasted me 3 months I ended up buying all the product because I loved the line , I have been using this set for over a month now and am surprised by the results My forehead lines are not as prominent and the quote marks between my eyebrows are gone I found that a little goes a long way The eye cream helps with my crepelike eyelids no puffiness but does not help the dark circles The moisturizer isnt too greasy which is nice I would buy this product again As a reference Im Asian and just over 60 , Heard great things but didnt meet my expectations , love this set so much Ive had it for around 2 months now I absolutely love it The moisturizer is super light it also allowed me to try some new products I have pretty sensitive skin and this worked great , After using this Laneige set for the last two months I am very satisfied with my results I switched over from Tatcha and will not be going back I noticed my skin looks more hydrated and skin tone looks even No trouble applying the product , I originally bought this product for seasonal dry skin and its great set value Initially when applying the hydro bank cream I loved the texture After about five uses it was evident that it does not keep your skin with that visible glow it claims to do It is quickly absorbed and not evident Skip if you have acne prone skin it is not noncomedogenic I however did love the serum and the eye cream in the set , Love this so much Glad I tried Smells amazing and akin feels so soft , The water bank moisturizer is extremely hydrating and has a luxurious feel its better than a lot of higher end moisturizers for only half the price I love that this kit also comes with a bunch of minis as the rest of the water bank products are great as well , Soooo good Absorbs perfectly into skin great for oily skin helped clear and heal breakouts Helps fine lines pores moisturizing without greasy feel 5 starzzz , Gorgeous product Super luxurious and moisturizing I already stay stocked on the water bank , i loved the toner it felt so nice and soaked in my skin well the hyaluronic acid serum was not very hydrating and i feel like it doesent go well with the hyaluronic night cream in the kit i loved the night creams old formulation but the new one is not it the eye cream was decent i wouldnt buy it again though i will be rebuying the toner , I bought this set to sample the line and am really enjoying it so far I have had a small breakout since using it but nothing major I love how hydrating it is It makes my skin so glowy and healthylooking , I got this set thinking I would love it because if the blue Hyaluronic but it was just okay Maybe its because the cream left my skin needing more hydration I loved the essence that came with it and the serum was wonderful If  too I think if your normalcombination skin its great but if your dry , This set is so average to me While I dont dislike it Im not wowed by it and have preferred many other products My favourite product from this set is the toner as its more of a gel rather than a liquid The eye cream is super thin which I dont like , Absolutely love this product Really makes your skin feel refreshed and really moisturized , I have combo skin thats dry in winter and this cream is lovely It truly hydrates and doesnt leave the skin feeling tight like so many other creams do I got the bundle honestly because of the deal BUT the serum and toner are surprisingly good They definitely make my skin more plump and hydrated and I feel a difference when I use the cream with other HA serums in my routine Going to buy the full sizes when winter comes around and use this for travel , Ive been in the longest relationship of my life with this brand I have combination skin and am super prone to breakouts When I started using laneige years ago I felt like I found my skincare soulmate The dark blue glass packaging Chefs kiss Then they changed the formula around a year later to the lighter blueombr glass packaging It was not as good as the original but not bad enough to get me to jump ship The quality deteriorated and they pared back the quantity but kept the same price Suspicious I held out hope despite the red flags I thought they could change and listen to consumer feedback Then this latest formula and packaging happened I was cautiously optimistic but theyve finally lost me with this lineup Im sad and probably going to be mourning the end of this relationship for a long time but its whats best for both of us My skincare search begins again , I saw this sets which is great priced but this sets have waterbank blue hyaluronic as for normal to dry skins Im watching a YouTube showing compared normal to dry skin and combo to oily skin The red dots is for normal to dry skin for the blue dots is for combo to oily skin I wish they is a set for combo to oily skin I will return this , My skin gets very dry during the summer after using this set Ive noticed a difference it comes with everything you need to reach your hydration goals My skin feels hydrated and glowy I received this set complimentary from Laneige now Im hooked will definitely keep using this brand Highly recommend , The Besties Kit gifted by Laneige is a great introduction to their line I really enjoy using the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer The cream smells really nice and has a great light texture that instantly absorbs The Lip Sleeping Mask in Berry is really nice too great way to hydrate and improve skin texture This is a great set for travel and a nice way to try their products , Love this moisturizer and for just the moisturizer in Canada its 52 and this kit is only 58 with all those minis omg what a steal buy it , All these products are so hydrating and at such a good price the moisturizer is so amazing I love it , Gifted by laniege This set is good to try different laniege products I love the lip mask and have used it for ages The other products are also great and work so well for dry skin It leaves my skin hydrated and moisturizer , I purchased this set on the recommendation of a friend who really likes the reformulation So far I feel it has made a slight positive difference in my skin tone and texture It seems to mildly reduce the appearance of my rednessrosacea and most products wont do that at all even if they claim to be targeted for redness I really want to keep using this and see if the results are lasting and worth buying fullsize versions I will update my review as I continue to monitor my progress using this set , I bought this thinking it would be super moisturising but everything is kindve average The cream has a lovely smell and texture but isnt anything to write home about  in fact despite using the whole regimen my skin is quite dry Perhaps this is for normal skin types more than ageing skin Im 38 , I bought this off the Laneige site but came here to save it because I actually love this line Id agree with the other review that the moisturizer can feel a tad sticky but I find that stickiness goes away after about 1015 mins of setting into my skin  The eye creamsyrum has worked wonders in the few weeks Ive used it tooFor reference I have an oily Tzone but normal to dry everywhere else comboish skin  Would probably not be the best line for folks with VERY oily skin but Laneige does have a line for those skin types as well , I absolutely love this product Ive always loved laneige and when I heard about this now set I had to try it The Blue Hyaluronic Serum is so amazing Im about to buy the full size and the eye cream also feels so good on the skin The moisturizer is the only one that felt kind of sticky on my skin not too bad but not amazing Overall I love it and Ive been using it every day skin has been feeling amazing"

bottle and apply before my serums and lotions and it adds moisture to my dry skin i tried the laneige milk mist but this works better to me , I use this under my moisturizer in the winter  helps add another lay of moisture which I definitely need , I have never been so happy with instant results from a product I have oilycombo skin w dry patches on my cheeks and around my mouth and nose After a few days most of my dry patches were gone One month later my skin feels so hydrated I use this AM and PM after cleansing before my serum or retinoid , I really wanted to love this product but as I was first applying it my face felt very sticky and left a greasylooking cast on my skin For reference I have oilycombination skin I let it sit overnighthoping it would sink into my skin the next morningbut my skin was just as greasy and sticky as it was the night before Although this didnt work for me I gave it to my sister with dry skin and she loved it It leaves her skin with a healthy glow and doesnt feel sticky or make her face feel greasy Overall I would recommend this product to someone with normal to dry skin for the best results , This has got to be the best hydrating toner ive ever used It leaves my skin feeling so soft and ready for moisturizer after Perfect for all skin types especially fry skin , Combo sensitive skin hereDidnt like at first because it felt sticky the night I used the sample but I really could tell a difference the next morningBought abs have loved ever since gave even worn under tinted moisturizer in the day and it was like a primer Bought the mini and it has lasted months , I received it as a free sample and I had to come back to get more It left me face feel so bright and it reduced the color of my eye circles the next morning and it about lasted a week until I used it again , Reallllly wanted to love this but I hate it it leaves your face SO STICKY and I think it may be breaking me out , The reason samples are so important is because you find amazing products for your skin Got a sample of Laneige mini cream skin toner moisturizer from Sephora but had not gotten around to using it Then my toner ran out and while it came in started using the Laneige toner and fell in love So much so that I then ordered the mini size and cant wait until it comes in After cleansing I put some in a cotton pad and just like all Laneige products a little goes a long way My skin feels hydrated and sometimes I forget about the next step in my routine because my skin feels so softSephora Laneige Skincare loveit , This is a unique product and doesnt quite neatly fit into what I expected but has become a staple of my skincare routineMy use is like thisIn the evening after cleansing and pat face dry I shake a small puddle of this into one hand bring my palms together to spread it in my hands and then patgently spread it all over my face and neck After giving it a few seconds to sit follow with any other treatments or moisturizerIn the morning I use it all by itself and follow it up with sunscreen if going outside or spot treatments if neededIt goes such a long way towards keeping my skin hydrated and calm much more than I expected  The tackiness subsides for me and just leaves a nice dewy finishMy skin is typically quite dry but combination and very sensitive and acne prone and this cooperates wellThe bottle is ok It delivers consistent squirts when shaked upsidedown but youll sometimes have residual product drying inside the screw cap to wipe off  This minisize goes a long way for me at this rate and I think gets a little messier than the fullsize  If I traveled with it I would probably want to tape the cap in placeThis fullsize has a cap that clicks shut and also seems to stay tidier longer than the minisize , Counterintuitive its not a type of creamy like a body milk or honeyish texture Light like a water You need to apply several times significant amount If you are a person with so dried out skin and loves using toner like a shower its yoursVery good hydration for my dry skin and makes my face brighter Talking about mini size bottle its so leaky I brought this for travel it leaked even with my max power twisting Leave it in your house , Wasnt right for my face however I am using up the bottle on my dcolletage and neck and thats feeling great , My skin type Extra dry around the cheek area no eczema or rosacea and oily tzone No acne However ultrasensitive many ingredients in skincare products which prove to be a headache to deal with I did and still do trial n error with numerous amounts or products to curate what works for my fickle skin Dont remind me about the total amount of I could cry From fancy brand names to generic brands what I learned is that name does not confirm its validity or of its claims with my skin My goal is to find affordable and reasonable products for longterm useI hate returning used items so I use them on my neck Hey it works After researching online I took a chance with this Laneige item I was quite surprised as to how moisturizing it really was Pleasantly surprised A product that actually does what it advertises WooHoo This isnt like your average alcohol or other dryingout propertyfilled toners This is heavily moisturizing This item is for dry skin only The sticky feeling after putting it onprobably means you dont need this itemYour skin may already produce enough or in overproduction of sebum from your sebaceous gland  If you have normal oily or acne skin do not buy this item Winter This provides ample  extra moisture to my skin during colder  drier months of the year Its heavensent Summer I use a lighter toner Because Ive experienced a bit of heaviness and did not want to over saturate my skin Laneige Cream Skin Toner  Moisturizer saved my Saharadesertlike skin past winter And reasonably priced I hope you love it too , He likes it after he shaves but I dont love it for me as part of a skincare routine , I wanted to love this but its way too sticky for my preference My skin feels hydrated but too sticky Ive tried it by itself as well as with the water moisturizer  same result I will not be purchasing again , Weird consistency literally like milk Leaves my face feeling sticky , This product is very hydrating and helps soothe my irritated skin when my skin barrier is compromised , To be honest I dont know that this does much for appearance but I LOVE how it feels I keep it at my desk when my skin feels parched through the work day and one spray is just so soothing , This toner is amazing My skin used to be so dry in the mornings even after putting on moisturizer I added this to my morning routine and my moisturizer seems to work so much better I highly recommend , I love this product for my combo skin ImOften dehydrated and one layer of this stopsMy skin from feeling tight and dry Pairs well with my routine  no peeling or breakouts , Im glad I got a mini size I used this daily and didnt really notice a difference Maybe youll get results using this long term I didnt feel like my skin was less dry or looked betterless redness Didnt do much for me , I have super dry skin and using this before hyaluronic acid makes my skin super soft but it also kind of feels like theres a film on my skin so its good , In my experience two in one or more products havent worked all that well but this one is so unique I have combination skin and this is great for me in winter especially I was looking for a new toner but was happy to find something which if you layer up 23 extra drops doubles as a nice light moisturizer and it keeps my winter dry face areas hydrated Also can be awesome for sometimes lazy people with their skincare routines aka me lol , I live in a dry cold climate so got this for the winter While its definitely not enough alone its a great toner step to add some extra moisture I thought this small bottle was a great size still havent run out and loved the product Id consider a full size bottle for next winter but also think the small one would do , I have normal to dry skin which is what the product is advertised for My skin is dryer in the winter and so far this is amazing I use VERY little and it goes such a long way for what feels like inside out hydration versus continuously adding moisturizer Few drops on a microfiber wash cloth and I dab all over After putting this tonermoisturizer on i wait a moment for it to dry and then ad just a tad more of my normal moisturizer My skin looks bright and fresh all day with just that but also looks great with foundation  That said I may switch up for the humid Midwest summer But for cold seasons this is phenomenal for normal to dryer skin , Despite the fact that I have very dry skin I would not recommend this toner As someone who uses Laneige on a daily basis with many of their products I would highly suggest their regular toner and pairing it with their moisturizer I found that this cream skin toner was heavy and left me feeling oily , I heard many great things about this product and it definitely met my expectations It maintains hydration throughout the day Its nice to use underneath a heavier cream that locks it all in Sometimes I like to layer it which Ive been doing lately in the winter when my skin tends to be drier It also has a nice brightening effect on my skin and my skin feels smooth and supple when I use it , Yup a year or so later I finally tried it  This richyetwatery treatment is very good  Doesnt leave any film even when doing a few skins with it and give a radiant shine to my facePerfect for seasonal dryness and sensitivities or to soothe after retinols or other actives  The mini is going to last a long time too , Very moisturizing and gentle Definitely good for winter time , This 2in1 product is great for people who are lazy me or are too busy in the morning for a multistep routine I use two layers of this product on my face and I find it moisturizing enough when my skin is normal in the summer it probably wont be moisturizing enough on its own for my very dry skin in the winter This mini lasted me 2 months of every day use Im not a huge fan of the packaging because you have to invert the bottle to get the product out and then when you have it right side up the product leaks a little on the sides I will be repurchasing this in the mist bottle same formula next time to avoid this packaging , I was really excited about the idea of using something more hydrating than the hydrating toning lotion I ended up disappointed since I think the hydrating toning lotion is more hydrating than this product But it doesnt dry out the skin and didnt cause any skin irritation , I got this lil deluxe sample of the Laneige Cream Skin Toner from Sephora with my last purchase Ive been trying it out and Ive really been loving it and feel like Im gonna have to go ahead and get the full size once I finish up this sample hahaIts definitely not a traditional toner so if thats what youre looking for this aint it However if you have dry skin or just want a super moisturizing toner step in your routine this is just amazing for that Its lightweight enough that you can use it as one of the first steps in your routine but moisturizing enough that you really feel like youre doing your skin a hydration favor everytime you use it , I wanted to love this It was recommended to me by a Sephora employee who was great btw  unfortunately it went on sticky and within an hour my skin looked oily I have comboacne prone skin I feel like this would be better for someone with dry skin I used it for a few days to try and give it a fair shot but this morning I woke up with a bit of a breakout Also I was not a huge fan of the packaging Its a quite tricky to get a few dabs of product I spilled quite a bit on my first attempt I feel like a drip applicator would be a huge benefit to this product , It surely gives some hydration but unfortunately this toner leaves a sticky feeling on my face after application However my skin feels fine after applying the rest of my skincare routine , I hope I love this I just ordered it I didnt want to pay the 27 for the mist but I decided to compare ingredients THEYRE EXACTLY THE SAME like exactly So for 15 mini Im gonna pour it in a nice fine mist sprayer and spray away , Only giving this 4 stars because of the packaging  Love the product but Laneige should consider adding a spray trigger for this as I dumped so much into my hand and lost 12 of the bottle , Awesome I tried Liah Yoos guide to use this on a cotton pad in the morning as a cleansing step instead of using cleanser in the morning but still being able to wipe away sebum and oils from the night cleansers are generally bad to use twice a day because surfactants even gentle ones can strip the skins natural barrier if used too often It is fantastic after that step you can simply apply another layer of the toner with just your hands if you want or if oily just do the one step followed by your choice of morning products I use vit cmoisturizerspf I also mix this in with my moisturizer at night , I received this product complimentary from Laneige I am obsessed It is super hydrating and it feels super refreshing on my skin It has no scent which is nice because fragrant products sometimes bother my skin Overall this is a great product and I really recommend it"
Midnight to Morning Hydration Set,"got a sample of the lip mask and thought Ill buy this set the reviews dont lie these are very small for the price should have been like 12 honestly , The products are good but dont buy the minis theyre not worth it So tiny and youre just better off buying the big ones , I got this for a friend for her birthday and its literally horrible no product at all  it will only work for travel nothing else  , The tiny lip mask has lasted me over 2 months of using it every night so dont be scared away by the tiny sizes A little goes a long way , The items are great but I am a little disappointed because I thought they would be full size , This is first time I am buying products from this brandand I like trying mini sizes firstMasks are good and clean ingredients and hydratingBut lip mask doesnt have clean ingreidents we are basically eating itThank God I didnt paid 20 for normal size product , After using it for a while I realized it keeps my face hydrated and glowing I love the affects and how you can bring it anywhere , I love these The water sleeping mask is my favorite so far it definitely makes my skin softer and brighter So far these have worked well with my extremely sensitive skin I use one of these every night , Amazing products I love the lip mask and the water sleeping mask Great set would 100 purchase again , ive heard amazing things about this brand and i was excited to try iti opened the box and it was the smallest size possible and wasnt even that shape not worth 21 dollars just get one of them , Love the face masks leave your skin so nice and the pink one is just the lip mask its so cute too i would say its travel size tbh but its just the same as the normal sized one , After using this product I am loving the results I am getting easy to apply , Works amazingly on my combination skin I was amazed how much of a difference I noticed the second day , This is a perfect travel size set its small and doesnt take much space Products are pretty good love both of the water and cica sleeping masks Dont love the lip mask it makes my lips more dry , All 3 of these are holy grails for me I have fair dry skin and i use one of the face masks and the lip mask every single night , I love this Obsessed beyond words I WOULD LOVE IF THE PACKAGE WAS MORE ECO FRIENDLY But omg so good , Tried all these products and am sooo happy with them My skin and lips look so much better , Great way to try some of laneiges best products Huge fan , So I know that a laneige does not really do full size but if they did for all 3 of those then I would have been more satisfied  and also my skin break out and its turned bright red right away , was slightly disappointed with the sizing of the lip sleeping mask and cica mask but they actually hold more than i thought the masks leave my skin baby smooth i can totally see the hype , I really like this set The cica mask is something that I wouldnt have picked out but Im so glad it came in this set Its very relaxing and I wake up glowing The only thing is that I wasnt expecting it to be so small , Only after I bought this product did I realize this brand tested on animals otherwise I would NOT have supported this brand otherwise its really cute and i love it , When I first got this product I was a taken aback by how small the containers were However a little goes a long way I have used the cica sleep mask 6 times and still have half the jar left I am obsessed with how soft this made my skin feel mmakes my skin feel , worth the hype i love the lip mask and you get a lot of product for the price love the water mask as well makes my skin super soft for when i wake up in the morning , I love this product The water sleeping mask and the cica mask hydrate my skin so much I recommend this if you want to try these products or have them and just want minis , Love the mask and getting to try all of them before buying full size , Super affordable very hydrating and perfect for travelling Very glad I got this set I cant decide which mask I like the most For the photo I added the regular la Neige lip mask for sizing context , i thought all these were lip masks but thats my mistake for not paying attention lol anyways LOVE the lip mask its my ride or die , ive been using this product for a week or so and i love it it keeps me hydrated , I absolutely love using the masks in my routine The lip mask is also amazing I even bought the full size 1010  , This product did not work at all and I also realized that Laneige tests on animals so DO NOT BUY , They are very tiny but honestly a little goes a long way so i dont mind and it saves me money Good quality , This set is perfect for travel or to just try out some laneige products The price is reasonable for what you get especially since the 3g lip mask lasts a long time however I wish the cica sleeping mask was just a little bigger because 10g will probably last 2 or 3 uses Not sure if the set comes with a lip  mask applicator too but it would be nice if it was included  , I received the lip mask as a sampler and decided to order the set as a trial for other products I cant say enough about the quality of all three products and the value you receive for the cost of the set Im thinking of buying a second Great way to try new products and have travel size available Excellent value and quality , Before buying understand they are mini like super small But that being said the products are great especially the lip one , Just bought this its not exactly what I expected the lip one is the tiniest which I what I wanted most I shouldve just gotten it by itself , I loved these SO MUCH Ive been looking for the water mask and the lip mask but I didnt want to pay 40 dollars plus I am looking for mini sizes And this was PERFECT The moisturizers were SO hydratingsupSUPER nice and really hydrating literally made my skin glow Theyre lip masks are so soft , pretty igh would buy bigger ones nextimethese look like samples to see if u like them or not , I love these products Super hydrating and amazing But I have one complaint if your going to buy it in the store check the box the see if the applicator for the lip mask is in there Mine was stolen But its ok i bought some off of amazon 1010 recommended"
Mini Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer,"Jadore cette creme elle hydrate bien Mme lodeur est bonnes Je lutilise comme crme de jour , fave moisturizer ever i cant even lie i have super dry and sensitive skin and this works so well on it my skin always feels so good after using , Absolutely love this product I am 40 and got to try this product before when I got a sample I fell in love with the product and ended up buying it at Sephoraonly store you can get it from It has a nice clean fragrance which I really like It glides onto your skin really nicely and evenly It feels light and doesnt feel greasy for hours like many other creams Ive tried Definately recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and that can appreciate a nice fragrant cream , Its alright if you have aging and combination skin that leans towards dry then I dont personally recommend this product I love their lip products but the smells of the creams are too overpowering and they honestly dont pack a punch for dehydrated aging skin , I have sensitive skin and this product didnt irritate my skin which makes it look soft and healthy , Im super shocked at the low ratings for this moisturizer It is by far my new favorite I recently upped my Tretinoin Rx and this is the only moisturizer that can help battle the dryness I layer it on top of a moisturizing serum and my face still feels super dewy at the end of the day , Loved the consistency of the cream Hated the fragrance and it left me with breakouts and reactive skin Did not feel as hydrated as it claims to help I ended up with terrible skin from using it with the water bank HA and so ended up having to return it and buy yet another cream to fix the issues it gave me , I received a free sample of this product awhile back Just started using it last week I am mad at myself for not using it sooner It is AMAZING My face always has dry patches and since adding this to my routine dry patches are GONE Goes on like silk a little goes a long way smells nice and does not make me break out Love love love this product , Keeps my skin so hydrated and healthy I recommend to everyone I know , i got this for my mom for christmas and she loves it so much she has pretty dry skin and is always raving about how much she likes this , I got a sample of this and loved it was definitely going to buy BUT Laneige does animal testing so if this is a factor that makes you reconsider buying DEFINITELY think about it , Solid moisturizer Feels nice and hydrating on my dry skin in the winter I just wish there was more product included because I really like to lather this on , After using up a sample of this product I ordered the full size only to be disappointed by the quantity inside I ordered a second one thinking it was an error but the new product has the same issue theisslimited quantity , Great moisturizer The only problem is the box Its huge but the amount of product is visibly smaller I definitely dont need this bulky box Otherwise nice product from Laneige as always , holy grail of all moisturizers and creamsleaves face flawless dewy and glowy , Not moisturizing enough for my skin Might work for others but I will not be repurchasing Scent is light and nonoffensive Did not irritate my skin , So I was very skeptical about trying the new formula And then I received the ten day sample which lasted me for 20 of the new formula and I decided to give it a try Now this review is based on that sample but Its led to my purchase of the full size To me its not very different from the old oneProsLess scent The new one has a weaker scent which I like The older formulas scent was strongerConsIts not as moisturizing as the old oneIf youre very dry this is an easy pass If youre okay with lesser moisturization and willing to layer moisturizers then you should find this a good buy Alternatively purchasing the water bank serum which I love and layer a moisturizer over it , I LOVED the Water Bank original moisturizer It was truly skin saving and my skin had never looked better I had heard about the reformulation and was hesitant to try it because the reviews werent great Well the reviews arent great because theyre accurate My skin is dry patchy and so so acne ridden I lost it  today when I looked in the mirror and saw just total redness Will never buy again , I used to LOVE the old formula This one definitely has a scent right away still hydrating Really wish they made a full size and not just a mini  , I got the deluxe sample box for a birthday reward and I loved the formula I guess it was now what is the older formula After I went through that sample size I wanted to buy a bigger size I saw that they did rebrandreformulate the product and I was skeptical I looked at the reviews and saw that it had predominately negative ones about the new formula I trusted the handful of positive reviews that I saw so I took a chance because if I didnt like it I could return it if it was slightly used and I have to say the formula is actually just as good as the older one it still smells great feels good on the skin and I can see a real difference in my skin after about a week of use Take a chance and take advantage of the return policy , I like the packaging its pretty cute This moisturizer is light and smells nice and fresh  only use a tab bit goes a long way I havent had a chance to try the old formula one so cant compare , Finished up a deluxe sample went to buy the full size because it was amazing only to find out theyve already changed the formula NOPE No thanks Do t like the new one Sigh whats with the constant reformulations and product switches Over it , I was nervous to buy this because I loved the original formulation so much and read some negative reviews I am pleasantly surprised Its not as awesome as the original but still great enough that I will buy the full size now , I loved the old formula but this is just nothing special Even the change in packaging is a step down Its no longer worth the price for me so Ill have to find an alternative , This is great for a pm moisturizer however this pilled up really bad with my foundation , extremely moisturizing makes my skin feel really soft and smooth perfect for dry skin , I dont even know what to say other than Laneige may have lost me with this one Ive been loyal to the WB cream for about 35 years and it was my everything Truly amazing Gold star That GIRL I literally recommended it to everyone I knew and they all loved it The OG dark blue was hydrating smelled amazing worked well with all of my other products and most importantly never broke me out Then came the middle child light blue packaging I coped with this one mostly It wasnt terrible It did what it had to do and I kept purchasing it But this last one I have no words No thoughts Actually I do why WHY Its just NOT IT This feels tacky on the skin and is just there giving nothing It doesnt feel hydrating at all and the smell is ok Then theres the packagingactually lol Im not even gonna address this because I cant What were they thinking Who was the target demographic Honestly please I have to know I hate to sound harsh but after using something this long Im upset Respectfully Im gonna need them to take the L , Consistent with what others are saying the new packaging is ready disappointing I absolutely loved and immediately became a die hard fan of this brand and now Im reconsidering whether Ill still be purchasing after the new packaging and formula Such a shame , Really used to love the old water bank moisture cream but had to try this one since thats no longer carried My skin broke out really bad but yet left me with dry patches on my skin and I used it for over a month to see if my skin would get used to the new cream but it just kept getting worse , Great product but Im giving this a 3 star because when I finally opened it all excited to use this and it was a quarter almost halfway missing for this price I expect it to be to the rim , I like it but its not nearly as moisturizing as the previous version of this product Also disappointing to see them move from glass to more plastic I was a die hard for the older one and now I may shop aroundsad , I made a really good research before buying moisturizer This one over here hit every spot I LOVE IT  helped me a lot  , I was suffering from very dry skin i tried so many products but after using this cream my skin feels so soft and hydrated This product works great for restoring skin moisture again I am totally gonna buy this again , Skin felt super smooth after use Will buy more when I run out , It is sooooooo nice a great lightweight moisturizer that nourishes my skin so good I have dry combo skin and my face always feels so gosh darn smooth after applying , This product is amazing its cream formula makes for all day and night hydration and absorbs well enough into the skin It really is like its predecessor but better I have very sensitive skin and there are no ingredients in here that seem to irritate me The only reason im not giving it a full 55 is because of the size difference there was more product in the old packaging The packaging here is adorable but it sacrifices the amount of product in the jar , amazing I love it It makes my skin looks soooooo good i am in love with this cream going to go buy some more"
Water Bank Cleansing Foam,"This product has made my skin feel so hydrated and not to striped after using it I am obsessed You definitely need to try it out , Laneige gifted me the Water Bank Cleansing Foam Ive been enjoying this as my morning and second cleanser I have dry skin thats prone to breakouts and I find this cleanser works well It has a pleasant fresh scent leathers well rinses off well and doesnt leave a film My skin feel nice and refreshed after using this , Complimentary from LANEIGE EUROPE I love this cleanser Love the size of the bottle and you only needed the tiniest amount to create a cream to foaming rich lather This is non stinging to the face but I do advice to avoid the eyes non drying to the face Its super easy to wash off any my skin is left feeling really clean and hydrated This cuts through grime and makeup and leaves no film on the skin This doesnt have a soapy smell This is to be used both morning and evening and it suitable for all skin types This promises to cleanse soften and visibly smooth skin , I really loved this face wash it leaves my skin clean and fresh and it makes my face ready for the rest of my skincare routine i dont understand how some people gave 1 star to this product , Jai commenc  utiliser ce produit rcemment et je ladore Il est rafrachissant nettoie mes pores sans asscher certains endroits de ma peau graisseuse dshydrate La crme paisse devient vite une mousse grce au contact de leau ce que jadore , I wanted to love this product so much but it dried my skin so much after repeated use , I dont think my skin has ever felt as clean as it does after using this cleanser My skin was SO dry and red and irritated from my last cleanser so I switched to this and immediately saw results of relief Will be buying this one d for myself from here in out , I love this Cleanser It is powerful and deep cleaning but it dosent leave my skin feeling stripped or to dry I use Inkeys Oat Cleansing Balm as my first cleanse to break down my make up and sun screen than follow with this  They work great togeather  I have sensitive skin that can get very dry I would repurchase this for sure D , After using this cleanser and the Water bank collection for the past two months I still have plenty left I can say it never dried out my face nor irritated it something I used to struggle with other cleansers I used it AM and PM It left my face with a nice clean and fresh sensation I wanted to see if itd eliminate the extra oiliness on my nose and chin but it didnt it wasnt very good at removing makeup residue either However I loved the serum and cream moisturizer This collection definitely gives allday hydration , I have oily acne prone skin and hydration is not something I struggle with but within a week this cleanser not only worsened my acne but also gave me some really bad dry patches Not to mention the really strong fragrance I got a mini size in a gift set so Id say these products couldnt keep my moisture barrier healthy let alone hydrate my skin , This face wash has been my holy grail for a year now It works wonder  Totally gets everything off your face and moisturizes as well Feels super fresh after Buy  , This is not the Laneige cleanser that I thought I was ordering but maybe they have discontinued the one in the travel size that I have used before After a few weeks of use I am quite pleased with this product its gentle and you dont need to use a lot  The downside is that it smells like your greatgrandmothers old bar soap that she used otherwise I might have given it 5 stars , Ive been enjoying this cleanser but it definitely leaves my face pretty tight afterwards so I wouldnt say its one of those gentle type of cleansers I wouldnt use it in the morning either It works pretty well for days when I need to take off makeup or remove sunscreen etc Its fairly fragranced but I find it pretty pleasant so I dont mind it In fact I like it when it can get rid of the icky sunscreen scene thats so hard to clean off sometimes Overall I would recommend , works great on oily skin and doesnt affect dry patches , This cream to foam cleanser feels really nice when applying and after rinsing off Leaves skin cleansed but still soft and hydrated Also a little goes a long way , it feels and smells like dove soapnot what I was expecting from its paired hydrating moisturizer , In the past i would have sworn by this Purchased my normal face wash and noticed the packing changed Appears formula has changed as well Face wash left film on skin Unfortunately will be switching brands , Really strips your skin Not a fan and very disappointed as I love Laneige , sooooo goodmakes your skin feel so clean and does not cause tightness or dryness , The best facial cleansing foam Skin feels healthy soft after used , this is an excellent product My skin felt smooth and supple bouncy  hydrated after my first use Fragrance wasnt overwhelming definitely more of a rich lather than a foam in my opinion Didnt feel any need to exfoliate after either The only reason Im giving it 4 stars out of 5 is because I felt as though my skin was slightly stripped afterwards I have may used a little too much I would be cautious if you have sensitive skin try a sample or a patch test first , I love this product  Is cleans so deeply in your skin  My face is very oily which I need to clean my face twice a day I do not use it everyday since its a deep clean I use it when I need to put make up on which leaves my face flawless  It also hides my huge pores  I also use the moisturizer which is a perfect combinaison  Would definitely recommend  , Drying for my sensitive combo skin I like a bit of a stronger cleanse in the summer months but this was surprisingly a bit too drying for me still skin felt taut after wash I even purchased the matching hyaluronic acid toner but skin needed quite a bit of moisturizing to even feel comfortable Definitely disappointing as I was really excited to add this to my rotation for the summer 2 stars only because the packaging and scent is right up my alley , This is very stripping  leaves my skin feeling SQUEAKY clean which isnt good and feels like it leaves a film It foams up nicely and feels great but just doesnt leave my skin feeling good  I have dry skin , My face feels super clean after using the cleanser it has a nice consistency too However the fragrance is quite strong and makes my face feel itchy after using Will likely return , The light cleanserlike scent was really nice price is good I love the brand and packaging but my first impression wasnt the best I followed the instructions for how much cleanser to use and I felt that squeaky clean feeling on my face afterwards Since I have sensitive skin I didnt love that feeling Overall it depends on your preference and skin concerns whether youd like this or not , This cleanser provided a great lather with also leaving my skin clean I have very dry skin so I always try to

BTS |  Amorepacific Lip Sleeping Mask Lip & Pop Edition Set,"Thank goodness a lip mask thats not fruity or overly sweet I absolutely love the butter one Not all of us are sweet addicts Some of us are more on the savory side If thats you youll love this especially you southern girls , I like candy and peach but i dont like butter  its smells like fake popcorn makes lips soft good value , Yes the Butter one is great but the set would have been much better if it just included a full size of it with a tiny original one with it The Peach Tea one barely smells of peach tea and the medium size of the classic Lip Mask is not really necessary there Would definitely buy Butter again if they released it as a full size , I bought this almost exclusively for Butter and it is absolutely worth it Smells amazing like buttered popcorn I cant live without it now add me to the chorus of voices asking to make Butter part of the permanent collection , They smell really good and feel moisturizingthis made my lips soft Priced well 24oz for 35 the regular ones are 20oz for 24 the scents are nice and not overpoweringButter smells like popcorn dynamite smells like sweet candy almost like a fruit roll up and permission to dance smells peach tea crystal li , huge fan of the Butter and Sweet Candy Butter has a mild popcorn scent thats not overwhelming  hopefully this becomes a regular product in their line , Please make butter permanent Its the best i cant live without it The others are good too but bought just bc of butter , Love the butter scent It reminds me of my childhood favorite corn flavored gummies The price of this pack seems to make it less valued than a regular size jar though , Butter smells kind of nauseating unless you like artificial popcorn jellybeans The peach smells just like the lip glowy balm and isnt anything special The bottom of my sweet candy was lose  kind of a waste of packaging why not just use smaller jars or actually fill them with more , The bombcom The butter scent is TO DIE FOR Smells exactly like the popcorn jelly bean  1010 for me , Product works great and packaging is super cut I bought one as a gift , The other two flavors are good but butter needs to be available full size Smells just like the real thing Its my new favorite added to my nighttime routine , So adorable and a great collection Items are exactly as shown and the products are wonderful , got this for christmas and was SO excited bc i missed out on the other bts ptd collab im in love with this set im usually not into eclectic flavors in lip balms so i wasnt sure how id like the butter scent but girl shes GOOD to me it smells like kettle corn but the popcorn note is faint again not a scent i would typically like at all but its a candy and peach iced tea are lovely and if you look at the total amount of product you get in grams 24g total its really not badly priced before this dropped i was considering the tatcha lip mask which is 28 for only 9g of product , Obsessed with the butter one I beg u please make it a full time flavor I got this as a present and I had to come back to buy a second one I cant live without the butter scent , Tbh I liked the butter scent Sure it might smell like popcorn to some but for me it reminded me of a bath n body works fall candle I wouldnt mind a full size of the butter , Im not a bts fan whatsoever but I like laneige lip masks so I wanted to try peach tea and it smells awful but butter is so much worse thank God sweet candy saved the day its great and I tried it before in the mini set they had for 19 dollars , perfection delicious wish peach iced tea had more scent soft on the lips exactly what I want from a kitschy adore pacific lip kit , Love the formula and all smell good the size is also good for the price , Im a huge BTS fan so I had to get these Got the last collab one the permission to dance gummy bear one and I love it Cant wait to try these , I love langiege lip masks it was perfect timing releasing this one as their last collab release last year ptd in Las Vegas gummy bear lip mask finally ran out these will last you forever the flavors are nice smelling and butter is interesting as it smells like popcorn I guess its if you perfer savory smells or to be a bit on the nose lol Im currently using permission to dance peach iced tea and it smells just like those powder ones you mix with water I got another one as a gift for my army friend too so these are perfect as a gift for anyone you know who loves bts  , Love the lip masks Sweet candy is my favorite but they all get the job done leaving my lips soft supple and moisturized , Ridiculous sample size What a rip off This is more like a free sample size , im not a bts fan but i bought this because they discontinued the midnight mini set Its a bit wacky but i love the butter scent i love the lip mask formula for everyday wear"
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Exfoliating Toner,"Definitely a repurchase  I dont need a super hydrating toner so I went with the Exfoliating one and it still hydrates while keeping my skin plump and not too oily , I love this toner Its a great addition to my routine Its not harsh It leaves my skin glowing and my other products absorb really well , I have a very dry and sensitive skin so usually laneige products are a big no for me since they tend to have fragrance and other ingredients that irritate my skin But so far this toner is pretty good Yes it still smells very perfumy but its a perfect base for my serum and other products The watery consistency is very easy to apply Dont know so much about hydration tho especially for the cold weather , I really like this toner Ive been using it for 2 weeks and my skin feels smoother and softer I also noticed that my essence and serum seems to be absorbing into my skin better after use slight stinging , did nothing to man skin its nice packaging but thats it , Normally I shy away from exfoliating toners but this one has been gentle and great I needed something to add into my routine to exfoliate a little bit without ruining my skin and this does that I am knocking it down a star though because the directions on it make it seem like it should be used everyday which I know better than to I use it only twice a week maybe three times AT MOST I think if I werent decently versed in skincare I would read that and do it every day twice a day and I can see someone doing that and that scares me I hope they make that more concise Otherwise great product , I love this It was recommended to me a while ago because I had mentioned my Paulas Choice toner stripped and dried out my skin even though I have an oily complexion This is amazing and my skin looked noticeably refreshed within two weeks , I have been using this toner for a week and absolutely love it so far It smells amazing and keeps my skin so soft  The packaging is also so cute , This is the best toner I have ever used on my skin I dont normally write a review but I couldnt help it this time I have oily combination skin with redness and acne concerns and this completely keeps the oil at bay during the daynight I apply both morning and night after cleansing with CeraVe SA cleanser and then follow with Avene light moisturizer With this routine I have minimized my acne by 70 The toner feels so refreshing on my face and I love the fresh clean scent Will never stop buying , Woh dude Ive never used a toner before so I didnt know what to expect Im very fair and blonde Im 29 and my skin is very sensitive This toner was gliding on my face it feels so soft and gentle It feels like water practically but with a cooling affect It also smells really good Im in love Im so glad I took a chance on it , It felt nice going on but I just cant do it with the fragrance Im worried my sensitive skin wont be able to handle it If it had no added synthetic fragrance I would keep it sigh back to Sephora tomorrow I didnt use it long enough obviously to see any real benefit If synthetic fragrance doesnt bother you go for it , My skin has always struggled with texture pimples blackheads etc I was in Sephora trying to look for ANYTHING to help my skin The lady I spoke to led me to the Laneige Exfoliating Toner and have used it for about 3 months and I saw changes in my skin almost immediately My blemishprone skin started feeling smoother and looking brighter This is definitely my favorite brand to use I will forever live by all Laneige products , this one is great if you have oily skin as this is what it was intended for it has a soft clean scent to it I love that after using it I see the left over oils and debris that my cleanser missed which makes me feel like my face is very clean leaves a very light moisturizing feeling if you want more moisture or have dry or dehydrated skin try their cream skin toner that is one of my favorites as well when I want extra moisture and hydration  if you have dry skin this may not be moisturizing enough for you but I really like this one for my skin , I have a dry skin type and this product instantly smoothes my skin Its gentle yet hydrating at the same time I had some small breakouts when I started using this like with any new addition to your skin care routine and especially for me as I wasnt using a toner before this I recommend this to anyone who has dry skin and need something to smooth and hydrate the skin The scent is really pleasant as well , Okay I do not leave reviews often but this has been the holy grail for my skin Ive told my best friends about it and ordered a bottle for my mom It feels wrong to keep it a secret Ive used this for a few days and almost all my skin texture is gone my skin is so soft and smooth I am OBSESSED If they ever discontinue this I dont know what I will do , If heavenly water had a scent this would be it The smell is so soft and pure smelling in addition to leaving the skin feeling so hydrated Amazing product overall , Im in love with this I put a little on my hand then put it on my face with my hands it foams a little when you first put it on which is pretty cool best toner Ive ever used Pretty hydrating as well"
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Revitalizing Toner,"I got the sample 2 months ago and I used it everyday and I just finished it so I cant imagine how long the regular size would last I feel like my pores did tighten up but just around my nose The scent didnt really bothered me and the product didnt made me break out Im definitely going to buy the big size , This is HEAVILY fragranced I dont have super sensitive skin but this made my skin hurt when I put it on Disappointing I got a large trial size from a Sephora promotion Glad I didnt spend money on this , Just like many other laneige products this one has fragrance so not the best for sensitive skin But feels super lightweight on the skin , I got this product originally as a sample and loved it so much I bought a full size Its more astringent than the Laneige Cream Skin Toner just enough to help with those pesky mask caused breakouts Its really gentle and doesnt dry out the skin , Great lightweight toner with a faint green rose scent sinks in quickly when pressedpatted in Will last a pretty long time for me when used in both AM and PM Ive been using it about a month and its pretty much full still , love how it feels on my skin and would recommend it has a good light smell and its an amazing toner , I love this product My skins looks very healthy and hydrated I have combination skin and this works perfectly for me I needed something hydrating because my cleanser contains salicylic and glycolic acid which strips moisture from my face In the day I pair my cleanser and toner with my Paulas choice vitamin C serum Paulas choice omega  complex moisturizer and the Innisfree sunscreen At night I pair my cleanser and toner with the Urban skin rx retinol rapid repair treatment and my day moisturizer I use my Paulas choice 2 BHA exfoliate instead of the retinol after every 4 nights Love the combo , Leaves my skin so hydrated I keep it in the fridge it feels so nice in the fridge I use it with the same line moisturizer Try it I have sensitive acne prone and sensitive skin My skin feels super clean every time , at first i hated it because i felt like it didnt target my texturehyperpigmentation but alongside the products i use for treatment i love it its amazing at hydrating , I love laneige but this product absolutely dried out my skin to reptile scales  I have fairly sensitive skin that is prone to drying out and this product is not for me , Dont waste your money on this Its terrible for sensitive skin as its loaded with unnecessary fragrance It irritated my skin every time I used it The key ingredients make up so little of the formula of this toner that I doubt they have any real effect Im very disappointed in this toner , Love this product I wanted to switch toners so I settled for this one This is so refreshing and I love the scent as well The scent smells like what clean magical water would be if it had a scent I really am enjoying this product , Says its for dry normal skin but I use this for my combo skin at night I apply like an essence so I pat on the skin by hand I see theres a difference with dryness but thats about it Good toner but not the best , 3 drops each time moisturizing enough without sticky feeling Go well with Laneige moisturizer then suncream in the summer time Reasonable price for the size , It is very light weight and hydrating This is my first toner and it feels like its making a huge difference in my skin care routine I have also tried the Cream skin toner and it feels like this would go hand in hand if you like to have a morning and night toner The fragrance is light and refreshing , I like it its light and moisturizing Doesnt leave a sticky feeling and absorbs wellDefinitely worth a try , Tried this new toner few times so far like the smell and its very hydrating It goes well with a light gel moisturizer for the summer time feels fresh"
Besties Set,"after using this product for just a couple of days my skin was SO clear and so hydrated its been a month or so now and I just love it the moisturizer a little goes a long way I have a good bit of lip mask mask moisturizer and cleanser although the serum didnt last long haha overall highly recommend , Im not even sensitive to fragrances myself but these products are way too strongly scented Its not even a bad scent its just too much of it , after 3 weeks I am still breaking out pretty badly I really love the lip mask and face wash but the other products are not worth it and irritating my skin , I love this set I like how it comes with a whole skin care routine at a low cost And if you like any of the products  they are relatively cheap to go buy again I also like trying new things so little sets like this make me happy and it comes with the lip mask so a win win for me , After using this product my skin has felt hydrated and smooth Low scent of H2O but I like it"
