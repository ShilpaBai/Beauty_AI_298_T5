chapped lips for me I highly \\nrecommend this product All of the scents are great Gummy bear is my favorite  \\nIve been using this for 3 months and it has saved my dry cracked lips my lips are always sore \\nbleeding and cracked after using this I have been waking up with really soft lips 1010\\n---\\nmoisturized lips A big caveat is that if Im not drinking water ie that time I lost my water bottle \\nfor three days there is no amount of lip balm that will fix my  dry lips Also if you like the Japanese \\ngrape flavour this is what the balm smells like exactly Which in my case is the perfect scenario \\nNot greasy or sticky and no flavour if you eat it A little goes a long way imo so the price is a good \\ndeal for me\\n---\\nI love the actual product but some of them smell like nothing  the vanilla and original berry \\nsmell like nothing at all The chocolate one smells like chocolate and is pretty good and the \\ngummy bear one smells so good  \\nOne of my favorite lip products  It keeps my lips from getting dry at night during the winter  I \\nadd several layers before I head to bed to make sure it stays on and I reapply in the mornings \\nand throughout the day as needed  This helps with chapped lips\\n---\\nIve always loved this formula for a long time I honestly dont even use it for night time I use it as \\nan everyday lip balm I love the texture Gummy Bear is my second most favourite scent \\nGrapefruit is the best in my opinion  \\nIf you have dry cracked lips this is a must have After a few weeks of use I have learned I will \\nalways have by my bedside I thought it was a little expensive but a little goes a long way It is \\nworth the price\\n---\\nlips and  inadvertently some of it will be ingested even if its a tiny amount Im not sure if thats a \\ngood thing If not for that I would have given 5 stars as the product itself does what it promises \\nto My Sephora Top 7 musthave list My top 7 musthave beauty product s of all time focusing \\nmainly on my purchases at Sephora1 Hair Loss Treatment Divine Herbal  Hair Oil 2 Shampoo \\nSephora Collection  Deep Cleaning Shampoo3 Face Mask Peter Thomas Roth  Pumpkin Enzyme\\n---\\nI love these This is my fourth flavor and I love it so much It leaves my lips looking glossy in the \\nday and hydrated in the night with a sheer pink tint I love these lip masks\\n---\\nThis product is so cute especially with the little applicator for your lips It keeps my lips hydrated \\nreally good and I absolutely love this product\\n---\\nflavours and they all smell really nice 1010 recommend  \\nLove this product I purchased this recently after having seen so many people rave about it and it \\nwas worth it It makes your lips feel hydrated and keeps them moisturized It is simply great  \\nI purchased the bespokeish BTS set that did include Sweet Candy aside from the limited flavors \\nThe most beautiful formula that melts instantly once applied to your lips even the more\\n---\\ngourmand flavors such as Butter eventually transform to a light berry aro ma and why I mention \\nthis is at that stage is where the application truly sinks into your skin When you wake up you \\nfeel every fold in your lips is drawn forward feeling more fuller and hydrated Basically baby lips  \\nAfter using this product for the last two weeks let me just say this I brought another one It \\napplies so smoothly and lasts long and keeps my lips hydrated and moisturized they got me for \\nlife\\n---\\nThis product is pretty good and it moisturizes my lips well My only issue is the taste and smell is \\nkind of artificial Great product though  \\nPros Made my lips very smooth Smells amazing Cons is a little pricey Test on animals But I would \\nrecommend  \\nAfter using the entire product I am not impressed with how much the product dissipates once \\napplied to the surface of your lips I like it for the thick shine and smell but thats about it Would \\nnot recommend it\\n---\\nchapstick  \\nFeels nourishing nice for sleeping but can still be worn as a lip balmgloss  during the day The \\nvanilla scent isnt as yummy as I was expecting and doesnt last I usually love vanilla but I think \\nthe fruity scents are much better  \\ni first didnt understand the hype around this product when i tried it at the store but i decided to \\ngive it another chance and i really enjoy it now you get a lot of product for the price and has an \\namazing sweet vanilla smell\\n---\\nleave them feeling super smooth and I like the little bit of color the Sweet Candy option \\nprovides All and all a great product but there is better out there  \\nI like this product overall I find that moisturize my lips and keeps them hydrated but I will say \\nthat I am very disappointed to find out that this brand tests on animals  \\nI got this as a gift for secret santa and after using this product for a couple of days Ive found that\\n---\\nThis product is amazing It really does smell likes gummy bears and leaves the best moisturizing \\nfeeling for a period of time Stays shiny like a gloss  \\nThis product is marketed as a sleeping mask but i would say its more of a lip balm It doesnt \\nhydrate at all so dont turn to this looking to help dry lips It doesnt last long at all But it does look \\npretty on the lips is not sticky and has a really nice butt ery texture Just wish that wasnt the only \\nupside\\n---\\nclogged pores around my mouth Dont believe everything you see online  \\nI received a sample with a previous order and gave this a try Wow I wasnt expecting much but \\nthis has made a huge difference in my lips I use it right before bed and its like first aid for my \\nskin The smell is pleasant and a little goes a long way I love t he little silicone applicator that \\ncomes with it Everything about this little baby puts it over the top Love it and highly \\nrecommend\\n---\\ndespite using this regularly for months I have like 9 of them in  random pockets desks in the car \\netc I always have one around but my lips still hurt I feel it does nothing for them other than look \\nnice and feel soft when actually on I would recommend it for a look but not for healing \\npurposes  \\nAbsolutely changed my lips suffered from very cracked and dull texturecolor After using for a \\ncouple weeks now they are so healthy and vibrant also
